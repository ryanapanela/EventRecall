The story starts off with a description of how Hollywood makes it seem that like getting thrown out of a moving vehicle isn't a big deal. Trevor goes on to talk about a particular Sunday when he was growing up. The bus routes were different for blacks and whites. There weren't any public transportations offered by people. The mini bus routes were organized by organized crime. One day they were waiting for the bus after he had breakfast in porridge. It was his mom, his brother and him. They were waiting for a while and he was like falling asleep. There wasn't any bus that was coming. They were waiting in front of rows, and his mom suggested to start walking in hitchhiking. They got picked up by a car, then they got cut off by a minibus. The guys who are bringing the minibus came out with clubs and threatening the driver. Then his mom said no problem, we'll ride with you. Anyway, they're waiting for the bus. The bus driver was harassing his mom and saying really unpleasant things and calling her a slut. His mom was being super polite and very calm. He was falling asleep. His mom said, I'm going to open the sliding door that's next to you, and you're going to jump. When the bus is slowing down, he was already kind of falling asleep. She pushed him out of the moving vehicle, and then wrapped his baby brother. She jumped out of the car and they started running once they landed. And the bus stopped. The drivers were kind of shocked down and couldn't catch up to them. They kept running until they got to a 24 hour gas station where they called the police. They joked about about how like, God wasn't looking out for them because his mom's really religious and and they were laughing about it, and they were covered in blood.
