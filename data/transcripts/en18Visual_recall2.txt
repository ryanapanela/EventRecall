Trevor talks about how when he was in grade nine, there were three Chinese students who transferred to school in Sandringham. There names were Bruce Lee, John and Bolo, who came from a family where his parents pirated. Bolo was pirating and selling pirated games to students in school. Bolo had a friend Andrew, who was pirating music and selling burnt CDs, to students. Some of the students weren't paying Bolo and Andrew. But they were too scared to ask for their money. Trevor said to them, why don't I be your middleman. Bolo left the school because his parents got arrested or suspected to have gotten arrested. Andrew is two years older. He was leaving. when he left, he told Trevor, like, you've been a really loyal partner. Here is my CD writer. He gave Trevor, the CD writer and showed him how to run his own operation. He started doing that and was pirating CDs,  rap or hip hop. And I guess like the internet that he was on was like, dial up. And so the CD would burn or copy at the rate of the song that was being copied. He had like a stereo system. But didn't judge people's tastes and music didn't really, like care too much about what people were asking to pirate. Then he had two other people added to his operation. They suggested, burning the songs that people want to hear. He started creating mixed tapes, and then doing like fading in and out of the songs. He used a program called BPM to help with that. He's making a lot of money, enough money to buy a cordless phone that had signal for him to walk the two blocks to McDonald's and still stay on the phone. Andrew who had initially given him this CD writer allowed him to start his own operation. With the access that his friend had and showing him he was able to start making some money and have the advantage that someone who had these things had.
