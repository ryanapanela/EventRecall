In Trevor's school of a thousand students, there were 3 Chinese students, one was named bolo, one was named Bruce Lee, and John. Bolo was his nickname because he looked like a famous person called Bolo. Bruce Lee was actually his name. He was a fit kid I think. Then John didn't have like a nickname or anything that was just his name. Bolo's parents were pirates. They would like pirate music and movies and sell it. Bolo did the same thing. His business was to sell pirated music to people. He worked with a white kid as well. They had a little business where they would sell CDs that we're pirated. One day, Trevor overheard them talking. They were talking about how some of the black kids would get their music devices but then the black kids would say that they would pay them back later, but then wouldn't pay back. They felt scared to confront them or say anything.  Trevor overheard this and told them that you have to negotiate with black kids. He asked if he could kind of be involved, like the middleman. He became pretty successful. The white kid had a CD box . Trevor thought it was really cool. He wasn't able to afford it. Eventually, Bolo's parents got arrested. He was out. It was just the white kid and Trevor and then eventually, the white kid finished and said, pleasure working with you. He gave him his CD box. Trevor now controlled the production and distribution. He was able to make a lot of money, because originally he had only really listened to Christian music, because it's all that his mom had played when they were at home. If you wanted VOB,  he had VOB. He was able to burn all these songs into a disk. He started improving his computer software and upgrading. then he was able to people started saying well, why can't can you do like a mix of different things. He hired he got two of his buddies to help them out with like selling every the CDs and everything. He was able to burn like people's favorite songs because they they said, Oh, well with people like there. They don't want to listen to the whole album. They just want to listen to their favorite songs. He would then make mixtapes of different songs. Afterwards, a few weeks later he was asked to make a CD with a smooth transition from song to song. Then he got an editing software and made a good amount of money, just because he was really good at business and sales. He was able to afford a wireless phone, so he could walk to the McDonald's down his street and back without hanging up on the phone. He was he would spend like, five or six hours just playing music to burn them. He had a bunch of different like music players that his stepfather got from the junkyard and different places that he had, so thats how he copied all the music. At the end, he starts talking about privilege and how without the white kid giving him the CD thing, he wouldn't have really been able to start his whole business. He had the ability, just not the resources. He referenced the phrase "if you give a man a fish you feed him for you feed them for like a night or day, but then you teach a man to fish then he you know, can fish for his life". He said that quote doesn't really acknowledge privilege. It would be great to have been given a fishing rod. The kid gave him his "fishing rod". The white kids family were preparing him to go to university and people from my village were, you know, just chanting like basic addition and stuff. There was just clearly this discrepancy.
