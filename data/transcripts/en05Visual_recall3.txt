Trevor talks about these three Chinese kids that moved to his school in which starts with an S. These three Chinese kids moved into the school all at once and all in one year, and they were the only three Chinese kids out of a population of about 1000. And their names were Bolo, Bruce Lee and John. Bolo got his nickname from a movie,  Bruce Lee's name was actually Bruce Lee, which was funny because he was good looking. The Chinese guy name was also Bruce Lee. The narrator says "Thank you, God for giving us Bruce Lee" because it was a joke in itself. For John didn't have to make a nickname for him. John was just John. Bolo and Trevor became friends with Bolo, because he frequented his truck stop. Bolo's parents were pirates. They pirated a lot of things. That's how they made their living. Bolo got involved in the pirating business as well. He would do that by giving people pirated games. He would take people's and then give it back with a chip and the ability to play the games that they wanted. He would sell it back for a price. That was his business. He met someone named Andrew. Andrew was also a pirate, and he would pirate things, CDs specifically. He had a CD writer, which was significant because at the time no one had a CD writer, they're expensive. He pirated CDs and would sell them. Bolo and Andrew were talking and they were saying how they don't like selling their products to black people. This is because black people often would say things like, Oh, I'll pay you back and they wouldn't get the money. They said that they didn't like selling to black people because of that. Trevor heard them and told them to not judge the black people for it. "We've gotten used to not having anything". "We've gotten used to being able to take things without having to pay because we haven't had the resources to pay for things, so we've gotten good at this". Andrew and Bolo didn't want to say anything to these people they were selling to that said "Oh, I'll pay you back". This is because they felt that they were scared of black people. Trevor offered to be the middleman of sorts to help them sell things. They wouldn't have that problem because Trevor's Black so he wouldn't have the same problem. So that's what they did. They started this kind of three way business with Trevor working as the middleman. It worked out pretty well for a good while. Trevor was pretty good at selling things. He noted also that Andrew was a bit of a computer geek and Andrew taught him like how to set up his computer. Trevor had started working on the CD pirating, but he didn't have a CD writer because that cost 2000 Rand and that was really expensive. He didn't have that part. Eventually bolo moved away. It was thought that he'd left the school and that his parents had gotten arrested because of the pirating. Bolo left the school so then it was just him and Andrew. Andrew eventually was reaching his graduation so he decided to quit the business. He gifted his CD writer to Trevor. Trevor was using the CD writer to then sell CDs and he was selling them for 30 Rand, which is about $3. That was good because at the time, when CDs were selling in stores, they were selling for 100 to 150 rand, so it was a significant deal. Once people started buying from him or buying pirated CDs, they wouldn't go back to buying them from the regular stores because the price was too good. His business was booming. He would continue to do that for a while, but he was noting that his copywriter had a 24 modem and it was at times one speed. He eventually had to upgrade to a 56 Something modem but this is the the CDs would still copy at the pace that the music played. He would have to sit there for five to six hours after school and wait for the CDs to be copied. It took quite a bit of time. It was worth it. It made him a lot of money. He was able to do things like buy a cordless phone at the time where nobody had cell phones. He had a really good cordless phone in which he was able to walk out the house and go down to McDonald's. He could also walk back upstairs into his room, all while on the phone on the cordless phone. He was that guy with the huge telephone and the antenna pulled all the way up at McDonald's. He was really grateful to Andrew for giving him that copy that CD writer because it helped him have enough money to eat endless McDonald's and buy a cordless phone. Eventually he got some middlemen as well, someone named Tom and another guy from a different place. He started detailing about how like when he was making the CDs. He wasn't really into music that much. He liked the saying, "don't get high off of your own supply" that drug dealers have. He didn't discriminate against whatever people wanted in terms of music. If you wanted Nirvana, you would get nirvana. If you wanted DMX, you would get DMX. And South African hip hop was popular. Mostly people wanted the American style Hip Hop, so r&b and hip-hop sold a lot. He said he sold a lot of Montell Jordan. He also got middlemen. Then his middleman suggested  that instead of making just a whole CD of one artist make a CD of hit songs, because that's really what the people want to listen to. They want to hear the songs that they really like. So then he started making mix CDs, and those ones are really popular, and those ones really took off. Then his friend also suggested, Why don't you make songs that bleed into each other kind of the way that like a DJ would play music live. Instead of it being from song to song, the music fades into each other. Trevor downloaded this thing called BPM, or beats per minute, where it was able to fade the songs into each other. Then he started making CDs like that, which was also very popular as well and gave the impression of like it being a DJ set. Then he starts to talk about the fact that he was really grateful to Andrew and how this couldn't have happened, and you didn't give him the CD writer. Then he starts to talk about how, when people are disenfranchised, it's difficult to put things into motion. Andrew was white and had a lot of the privileges that his people didn't have. So, for example, Andrews family while they're prepping to go to university for all these years, his people are still kind of doing the two plus two times two equals four type of math and in huts, he said. These are things that people like Andrew take for granted. The simple act of handing him the CD writer made a big difference in Trevor's life and it wasn't something that he would have ever been able to buy. Trevor talks about how despite him having these skills and being able to sell something, it wouldn't matter, because he would have never been able to get his hands on the tools to be able to implement that skill. He talks about the saying, "you give a man a fish he eats for one day you teach a man to fish and he eats for life". He's saying the part that's missing from that is, you know, it would also probably be good to give that man a fishing rod which was something that was missing from that quote  That's something that's often not talked about when we talk about the differences between poor people and disenfranchised people. A lot of people will say to poor people to put on your bootstraps and work or you know, just figure it out and do something and find a way to make money. We don't give those poor people the opportunities or the tools to be able to actually do that and to be able to take themselves out of that place. It doesn't matter if you have a skill if you don't have that resources, and then that's when he realized that you do need people from a more privileged position someone like Andrew to teach you the way show you the way and give you give you tools in order to be successful. Because you know, regardless of him being a salesperson, a good salesperson, it wouldn't have mattered if Andrew hadn't given him the CD writer.
