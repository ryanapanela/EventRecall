One morning Trevor's mom's car didn't start. After waiting a while for it to work, they decided to hitchhike because the bus on the bus route wasn't coming. When they hitchhiked, the people from the bus found them. They were mad that this other guy had picked them up. Although their bus hadn't shown up to drive them themselves, they got mad and started to fight the guy that was driving them. Then Trevor and his family, his mom and his younger brother got into the bus.
