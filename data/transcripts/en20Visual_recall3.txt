Trevor speaks about how in grade nine he met a few Chinese kids at school. One of these Chinese kids was Bolo which was a nickname given to him. Because he looks like  this actor from a movie, whose name was Bolo Yeung. Bolo's parents were professional pirates so to speak. They pirated video games. Bolo pirated video games himself, then selling them to kids at school. Bolo became friends with a guy named Andrew in the story, and Andrew knew how to pirate CDs, and sell CDs to people. They became partners in a business, so to speak. One day Trevor overheard Bolo and Andrew complaining about selling pirated video games and CDs to black kids at school, and how the black kids would never pay. Trevor told them that the black kids just don't have any money to pay you. But he can help them by being the middleman in this business relationship. He would help them actually get their money. He would take a little cut from it at the end of the day. But Bolo and Andrew were very open to this idea. Over time, Andrew, us kind of started showing Trevor how to build his own computer. Andrew was a big computer geek. He showed Trevor how to like upgrade his computer. Eventually, Andrew Got tired of selling his own CDs and Bolo moved away. It was rumored that Bolo's parents had actually gotten arrested for their professional pirating business. Andrew decided to run the business. And in doing so he gifted his CD writer to Trevor, and at the time, having a computer was was a crazy thing. For many South African kids for many black kids, let alone a CD writer. Trevor was very appreciative of of Andrew providing him the CD writer. He started pirating CDs and starting his own business, he controlled production, sales and distribution all on his own now, and so he was pirating CDs, and selling them to kids at school. He described just going home from school every day and pirating CDs, that's what he would do, he would even use. He even bought like a stereo system or something out of out of old car parts from from his stepfather Abel's auto shop. He would pirate CDs. It was a very good business. He was selling a lot of a lot of CDs. Over time, he became friends with a couple of people that he knew. One of them became was one of his middlemen, so he belonging was selling to others, whereas, Trevor was the supplier of those CDs. They gave him a couple of great idea saying, you know, you should mix tracks from different albums onto one CD, so people can just listen to the best songs from each album. you could start making songs fade in and out from each other on one CD, so it sounds like a live DJ set. It can be great for parties. And those ideas really, really worked and made Trevor rich, it grew his business a lot. And he was selling CDs like hotcakes. To the point where he could even purchase a new wireless phone, which no one had at the time. So reflecting upon all of the success, He really appreciate what Andrew had provided him. And Andrew was white. And you had all of his resources, knowledge and education during this time of apartheid. Whereas Trevor didn't have the same resources as and so as he said, Upon his reflection, he realized how important it was to empower those who don't have the same access to knowledge and resources as others. The analogy he uses that is that when you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day, but when you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime, but no one mentions the fishing rod that you should give that man to help feed himself for a lifetime. He reflects upon the fact that, without Andrew providing his CD writer and this knowledge to him, he wouldn't have had such a successful business in the first place.
