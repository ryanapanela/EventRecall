The story starts off by mentioning three Chinese kids, Bolo, Bruce Lee, and John. However the beginning of the story focuses more on Bolo. It starts off saying that Bolo came from a family whose parents worked as piraters of CDs, movies and video games and that bolo continued to walk his parents footsteps and would do that at school as well. He would pirate video games and then sell them to students at school. Eventually, another kid named Andrew decided to work with Bolo, and he would also sell pirated CDs because he had a CD writer. So as their business grew in school, they ran into some issues with some individuals from the black community, saying that they would get the CDs and video games from them, but tell them they'd pay them back later and never pay them back. So eventually, this guy Trevor, who was also part of the black community, decided to team up with Bolo and Andrew. Andrew was also white. He teamed up with Bolo and Andrew and worked as a middleman. He would sell the CDs and video games from Bolo and Andrew to the other people and then he would give them the money. He then get a cut of the money as well. So the three of them worked together for some time and then eventually, I think after a year or so, Bolo, and Andrew stopped their business. And then Andrew eventually gave his CD writer to Trevor. Trevor has started his own business himself. So he started making copies of CDs, making copies of full albums. And then eventually, he started getting songs off the internet for people if they requested it. So he started selling CDs, to different people, and his business started to grow and grow. Eventually, he got so big that he needed to get two other people to help him. One of his friends his friend, Bogani, made a few suggestions to him that helped increase his business, he suggested that instead of just copying full albums, to copy the best tracks on the albums, and then compiling them into like a mix CD, and sell those instead, because people would just want to listen to like the better songs anyway. So he did that. That helped his business more. Another suggestion that he made was to crossfade songs so it sound like the type of music you would listen to in a club. So basically, DJs can use those kinds of CDs as well. And that also sold really well. So his business was booming at this point it he made so much money so much that after the time he was able to afford a portable phone and not really a cell phone, but like one of like those big brick phones, I guess maybe this took place in the 90s or something. He gave an example in the story saying that he could be on his phone and walk all the way to McDonald's and get a meal and then come back and then continue his work. So that's how great his business was, especially for him and the community that he was a part of. Then eventually he went on to compare his life compared to Andrews life. He says Andrew comes from a white family and a more privileged family with more money and more opportunity and compares himself who was a person of the black community who didn't have that many opportunities as Andrew. He was very thankful for being able to work with Andrew and have his business boom because of Andrew and because he gave him a CD writer. So he was very thankful for Andrew saying that even though he was given something he  did put in a lot of work to be able to build up his business and not just inherit some kind of business.
