Trevor says that in movies we see people fall off the cars and just get back up, pretending they're okay. But in real life, that doesn't happen because he went through something similar that day. The story starts off with trevor talking about how his mom got him breakfast. While he was getting ready, his mom was getting his younger sibling Andrew ready. They all went out into the driveway and like sat into the car, but it wouldn't start. Then they decided to wait for a minibus. Where they live, the government doesn't provide transportation to like black communities. So they created their own transportation system, which involves many buses. They have their own transportation system. People who would drive mini buses always had like conflict within them. It's like people were it was unreliable. The mini buses would always be unreliable, come whenever they wanted. people stuck to their own bus routes to avoid danger, since stealing routes would be met with aggression. They waited for a while, but the minibus didn't show up. They then decided to hitchhike. They walked around. They finally saw a car and they stopped. Just a few minutes later, they saw the minibus go past them. The people from the minibus stopped and the people got off the bus. I guess they were from a different tribe, called the Zulu tribe. They got out their Zulu weapon, which was a club and they started to try to hit the car driver. They were like, Oh, why did you steal our customer? They were supposed to go with us. Then the mom was like, no, my intention was to come wait for the minibus will get off. We'll come with you don't hit this man. They got off and sat on the minibus. The bus drivers also tried to make conversation with the customers, but they were also being rude to them and getting angry at them. The bus driver kept talking to the mom and being like, Oh, why would you be in the car? You're a married woman. Why would you be in a car with another man or something along those lines? He noticed that she was speaking another language, which was from another tribe. Usually those two were like rival tribes. The bus drivers were from the Zulu tribe, and the woman and her family are from another tribe, where one of their kids was a mixed kid. The bus driver kept taunting her about that where Zulu women are usually considered being more like faithful whereas the other tribe women are like unfaithful and they consider them as hoes or sluts, and then he kept telling the mom or why would you, like, marry a non black person? The driver kept getting more aggressive and making comments. Then traveler the kid was like, throughout all of this was like kind of dozing off. The tribals eventually we're getting more violent and trying to be aggressive trying to kill them threatening to. Once the minibus slows down or comes at a signal, we should get out of the car but trevor was not awake for this since he was dozing off, almost falling asleep. When the minibus came to a halt, at the signal, the mom immediately opened the sliding door, pushed trevor outside, again, half asleep, and then grabbed the younger baby in her arms and fell out the bus too. Trevor suddenly woken up and felt confused. Then his mom just said, run and he ran. And he just ran, he said, it was more like a natural animal instinct. With how he grew up, it was just a natural instinct for you to run, and they kept running as fast as it could. Eventually, the bus drivers gave up, since they ran super fast. They we're already quite ahead. And then I guess they mentioned how they were college. They did running in college. And that's why the family was good at running. They just ran and ran and then the driver was couldn't catch up to them. Eventually, they finished at the gas station. They tried to call the police, but then the bus drivers had already left. Once the adrenaline was wearing off, they realized like they were all bruised, I guess. The baby was fine since the mom just held him in her arms, and they were all bruised and just. Trevor was arguing with his mom, and he's like, what was that? What did you just push me off the bus? And the mom was like, No, I mentioned it to you. And he was like, No, I was asleep. And I guess the mom said, well, thank God, we're all okay. And then Trevor mentions how like, Why are you thanking God? Jesus gave us a sign that we shouldn't have left when the garden start and he was the devil that was like, prompting us to go out and like take the bus. Then they had a funny argument about it. After that, the argument just ended in laughs and they were like, fine after they just laughed the whole thing out.
