He would take a lot of time to get his hair done, go to salon and maintain it so much that his mom would tease him about it. They would tease each other saying who would be the most better looking person in the family. He then went on to describe his mother talking about how she'd get ready for church on Sundays, and that she would spend much less time getting ready compared to him and still come out looking much, much better and more beautiful. He just described that his mother was like a very beautiful lady. He talked about like how much she observed her and loved her as his mother. He then went on to talk about this man, Abel, who worked at the mechanic that him and his mother would go to eventually. Abel and his mother got married and gave birth to a son named Andrew. So Andrew became Trevor's younger brother. So growing up, Trevor really didn't pitch in to take care of Andrew much because he was just focused on you know, growing up and living his life. Trevor eventually became a comedian, and did like a bunch of things such as going on comedy tours. He would host of a bunch of shows and did a lot of interviews.
