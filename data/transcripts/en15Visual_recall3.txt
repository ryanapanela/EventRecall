The story starts out with the main character, talking about how in big Hollywood movies, there will often be characters who get thrown out of cars. They get up and dust themselves off and are completely unfazed and unharmed. He says that it's a complete different experience than what they portrayed it to be. Getting hurled out of a moving car is much more painful than it looks in the movies. He starts telling a story about how on the day that he was hurled out of a car. It was a Sunday morning and he started his day off with his mom waking him up and making him porridge in the morning. He took a bath. His mother got his nine month old baby brother dressed and they were heading to church. When and then they met on they got in the driveway the car wouldn't start. They decided to call a minibus. This was because public transportation wasn't available to black people back then under apartheid in South Africa. Black people were still expected to clean their bathrooms, their floors and do their janitorial work, despite being separated from them in institutions and places. The minibus organization was started by black people. The main character describes it as necessity being driven from innovation. So black people invented the mini bus system, which was an unregulated, and technically illegal organization of black people who would map out routes to transport their people. Sometimes,  if it came, it came and if it didn't come, it didn't come. it was often unsafe, because drivers, some drivers and passengers would be violent, so some paid for protection. You could even be killed if you stole another person's route. It was very risky and unreliable. The main character, his mother and his nine month old baby brother named Andrew were waiting. He was falling asleep at this time, while they were waiting for the minibus to come. They decided, You know what, let's just hitchhike or the mother suggested the hitchhike. They walked for a long time until they found a car and then they got in the car. Not even 10 feet of driving, a minibus swerved in front of them and cut them off.  Zulu men holding a war club which was meant to bash people's skulls in and he went to the window of the driver's seat. And he kind of put it in the club in his in the driver's face and said, Why are you trying to steal my customers or my passengers? The mother told the Zulu man to leave this man alone. He has nothing to do with it. That's what we were planning to do anyway. They got out of the car and got into the minibus. The mini bus drivers are often known to be very violent and known to often bother their passengers, I guess. The driver was lecturing the mother about getting in a car with random men. But the main character talks about how hhis mother doesn't take lectures from strange men. She obviously protested to his lecturing and this resulted in a heated argument and angry back and forth, it was mostly the driver. Then when the mother started speaking her language which really angered the driver. Since the driver was Zulu, there were strong stereotypes of Zulu women and, and the mother's type of women were Zulu women were known to be known to be dutiful and faithful and the other women were known to be promiscuous and unfaithful. The driver started accusing her of being a slut and a whore. He even noted that her son, which was a half white, half black child, he accused her of like sleeping with white men and being unfaithful, and sleeping around and then and then she started arguing back with him which set him off. He said, you're gonna learn your lesson tonight. He started speeding past intersections, and stoplights and down the roads, and only stopping at only at the major intersections before speeding up again. At this point, they could have been raped, they could have been killed. But the mother still remained very calm. She was trying to bargain with him and say, We're sorry, we didn't mean it. You can let us off here. You know, we can let this go. But the driver was refusing. He said no. They were speeding at such high speeds. But the mother whispered, or Yeah, whispered or told the main character, Trevor, that at the next stop, when he hits the gas, that she's gonna slide the back door open and or emergency door open, and they'll jump out of the vehicle. He was too tired to even make out what she was saying.  She then hurled them out of the door, throwing Trevor first and then wrapping herself around his baby brother and then jumping out of the minibus. When Trevor landed, he was kind of dazed and confused. It all just happened so fast. Then his mother landed right next to him. Trevor went from being half asleep to wide awake and confused about everything that's going on. His mother told him to just run, run and don't stop. Immediately his like instincts kicked in. He says that if he had grown up anywhere differently, he would have stood there confused, asking why his legs are sore and asking where they are and what happened. But instead, he knew how to run when he needed to run. When his mother told him to run, he ran like a gazelle. They kept going and going. The minibus stopped and looked back at them, and even tried to chase after them, but they couldn't catch up to them. They the mother and her sons smoke them. The main character describes that the drivers probably can't believe that this woman with two young sons and a baby can run that fast without much speed. He credits this to her time doing sports at her college.  They finally out run them they kept running and running until they hit a 24 hour gas station or convenience store where they finally looked at each other look down at themselves and realize they were scraped and bleeding and bruised everywhere. And at this point, he gets in a heated argument with his mother. He's angry at her asking why she pushed him out of the minibus without warning, and not really not realizing at the time that she actually saved his life. She started arguing back with him like, would you rather I left you back there? Would you have preferred that? And then she starts thanking God and thanking God that they're alive and that they're, they've escaped. And the Trevor argues back with her and protests and says, this isn't thanks to God, because if it was God's work, he would have she would have taken as a sign to just stay at home and the car initially didn't start instead of taking a minibus. The mother argued back with that and said, its Jesus' doing that we're safe.  Trevor said, next time, maybe ask Jesus to meet us at home instead because that because they already went through a lot in that day.
