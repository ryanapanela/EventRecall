The story starts with Trevor, recalling how he had started getting like his hair straightened with cornrows at the salon. This was helping him get noticed by girls at a dance. He liked this. He kept getting his hair done to continue getting attention. He and his mom joked around. His mom said, "I could never date a man that spends more time on his hair than I do". the story transitions into him recalling his mom's youth and how he doesn't want to say she is pretty since she is because it is weird. She was in her overalls inthe garden and still looked like a very attractive woman. She worked from Monday to Saturday. Then on Sunday, she used to dress up to go to church. She even joked and said she never had to spend hours at the salon to look good. She even looked good after a shower. Then he talks about how he was sure she broke many hearts because of how attractive she was. He starts talking about how there's only been two men in her life: his father and his stepfather. He started talking about how near his father's home there was a garage which they would take the Volkswagen to get it fixed. Because it used to break down a lot. Abel worked there.  Because of how often the car would like break down, they were at the garage, very often. Then he started noticing that Abel and his mom were getting together because she would go there even if the car did not need to be repaired. She always said that he was good looking. I mean, she kind of jokes that women of like a certain type of ugly that they find attractive in a man. He says that like there's like nicknames that They gave each other like Abby and a nickname starting with an M. Then he recalls that they got married. But there was no ceremony, no exchange of rings. They just went and got married. Then a year later, she had his baby brother, Andrew. He remembers this, like his baby brother being in the house crying, eating, being fed, and shitting. He recalls that he's was already nine years old when that happened. Nothing really changed much for him. He wasn't changing diapers or anything since he was playing in the arcades and running around the streets. So nothing really did change for him. Then  fast forward to a time where he was working as a comedian, going around the country. One morning he gets a call and the call says it's from his mom. But when he picks up and it's his little brother Andrew. Andrew goes Hey, Trevor,  how are you? Trevor responded saying he was sleeping and He's good. Then after our little chit chat, Andrew says his mom's been shot. Trevor is surprised, but he also thought Why did Andrew not just say mom's been shot the first time around? Like, why? Why did he say Hey, how are you? Andrew remained very calm over the phone. So, Trevor didn't think it was really serious. At the at the back of his head he knew he didnt have to ask Who shot mom. He just knew that like it was like a man who shot mom. So he got ready really quickly. He told his friend that his mom had gotten shot. He also asked Andrew where they were going and then Andrew said, the hospital. The hospital was 15 minutes away from where Trevor was living at the moment. He and his roomate got dressed really quickly. He was driving to go to the hospital and during the drive there, Trevor calls Andrew again. Again, Andrew is super calm, and very relaxed on the phone. Trevor asks what happened. Andrew goes, oh, like they were coming back from church. And I was waiting. She shot her once in the leg, and then once in the head. Trevor loses all of his emotional stability and he starts bawling his eyes out. He remembered the exact stop light where Andrew had said mom had been shot in the head. He was still trying to to drive with tears blocking his vision. Then while hes driving he thinks about how many times the police should have done something with Abel and how his mom didn't deserve it. He gets to the hospital, and sees Andrew and his clothes are all bloody. He's right outside the emergency room. As soon as Andrew sees Trevor, he starts bawling his eyes out. Trevor felt like he'd kept it together until he was there and then he just let go when when Trevor had arrived. The doctor said that she was stable and that there was nothing  they could have done at the moment. they told Andrew and Trevor to go home and come back in the morning. They go home sleep and then come back in the morning. In the morning, They see their mom and her head is bandaged at the back. One of her eyes is also bandaged, with scrapes and cuts on her face. He holds her head and her hand. She opens her one eye.  Trevor is bawling his eyes out. his mom is reminding him to not like be crying and says It's okay baby. His mom opens her eyes. Trevor thinks she didn't deserve this and they should have done something about Abel a long time ago. He even wonders if he should have just killed him even though he knows he's not like capable of killing anyone. Then, his mom opens his eyes. Trevor gets mad at Jesus, and asks why  Jesus like let this happen to her.If he had a fanclub, she'd be at the top 100 because of the amount of times she prays. Trevor talks about how unfair he is for this to be happening to his mom. He can't control his crying. She then says, Don't worry, it's okay. I'm alive. Trevor says, Well, I thought you were dead. She's like, Yeah, but look on the bright side of things. Trevor says like, there's no bright side of to this situation. She then says "Well at least you're the better looking one in the family". They then joke while he's crying and laughing at the same time.
