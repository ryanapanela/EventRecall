This story is a nine year old kid jumping out of a moving vehicle.  The main character says that in the movies, "jumping out of a moving vehicle is cool, But I actually did it and it is very not fun". Then the story starts in a normal kitchen, household, domestic setting, and the family, the main character, their mom, and their little sibling needs to go home in the night. It is South Africa, and there's a bit of exposition in that it's very dangerous at night. If your car won't start, there is an informal network of transportation for black people. If you have the wrong driver, you could get killed. Off the family goes because they need to go home and their car's broken. They wait around and try to hail a ride. The first person that they get is an okay person with a small car, I think, and they drive along. Then they meet a large bus. One of the bus drivers comes out with a war club and starts threatening the small car. The main character's mom says, okay, we'll leave you alone, we'll just hop into the big bus because they were talking about stealing customers. The mom gets her two children into the big bus. Off they go. It seems everything's okay, as well, because everyone knew each other in the informal transport economy there. However, their mom was part of a certain ethnic group in South Africa. The bus driver was of another group and they held a grudge and their mom was speaking in her in her language, and the bus driver got more angry. Then the mom also got more angry. Then the bus went faster and faster. The bus driver suddenly stopped talking and was just going to speed them away somewhere probably to get murdered or raped. So the main character is mom told her two children, "we are going to jump from this moving vehicle when it slows down at the next red light or yellow light". The main character at that point was sleepy. He thought everything was fine, because his mom had stopped arguing, but she was just very calm, because she knew they were about to die. At the next red light, when the bus driver had to slow down, the mom threw him, threw the main character out of the bus, and then she grabbed her baby, and then jumped out of the bus as well. The main character rolled to a very painful stop, and their mom dragged them up and told them to run. They ran through the streets and the main character said they were the champions of some track and field competition. The bus drivers tried to chase them but couldn't catch up. The family ran all the way to a 24 hour police station, where the mom finally called the police and had them drive them home. That was the end of the danger and waiting at the police station or convenience store. The main character was old enough to know that their mom got them into this mess and they started arguing.  The mom first said, "thank Jesus that we got out of there alive", but the main character said "it was your fault", for choosing to take a informal bus in the first place we should have called we should have went home another way or we gotten the car fixed. Then they made up and started laughing.
