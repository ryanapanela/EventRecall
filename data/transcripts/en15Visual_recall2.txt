The narrator talks about getting cornrows for a  dance. He began getting a lot of attention from girls in a way that he's never received before. He would spend four to five to six hours in the hair salon just to look good. He didn't know if it was because of the effort he put into looking good or his hair that made girls attracted to him, but he didn't want to question it. His mother told him that she wouldn't want a man who spends more time on his hair than she does. Then the main character starts talking about his mother and how most days she's at her office job or gardening and looking like a homeless person. Then when Sunday comes, she dresses up for church puts on her heels and her nice dress. She gets ready and looks like a million dollars. And she would always tease him whenever she would get ready and  poke fun at him that he spent so much time trying to look good and with doing his hair. So she would poke fun at him and tease him. there was this car mechanic repair shop around the corner near his dad's house where a man named Abel would work. And he was very lean guy but still had big hands and muscular body. He would be able to carry big engines and work on cars. The main character describes him as handsome but not good looking. That's exactly what his mom liked. She liked a certain type of ugly in men. Abel and their mother got married one day, no ceremony or anything. They just signed the papers and got married. About a year later, they had a child. The main character doesn't remember it happening. She was gone for a few days. She came back with a little baby who just cried and screamed. He was nine years older, so he didn't really have responsibilities to change his younger brother's diaper or anything. He would just go off and play video games or arcade games. Then years went by and life went on. He went on to be a comedian. He traveled and toured the world. He hosted radio shows and podcasts. Then one morning, he got a call from his younger brother or his baby brother named Andrew and he said, Trevor, are you busy right now? Mom's been shot. And Trevor's first thoughts were "Why would he asked me if I'm busy first?". The first thing that should have came out of his mouth is Mom has been shot. Trevor didn't even have to ask who shot his mom. He automatically knew it was Abel. Andrew said they were at Brink's Springfield Hospital. So he said he'll be on his way. He called he his friend and said, my mom's in the hospital we got to go. So his friend also rushed to the car with him and they went to the car and got there as fast as they could. On the way to the hospital, Trevor was obviously worried, but he wasn't. He wasn't as fearful that she would be dead because she assumed it wasn't. She wasn't fatally shot, and it could have she could have been shot in the leg or something. But then he called Andrew again, and asked him for an update and asked him where she been shot. As soon as he Trevor that she was shot, Andrew gave details on what happened. They were coming back from church, when Abel got out of the car and started shooting everywhere and then shot their mom in the leg and then in the head. And as soon as Andrew said that Trevor started bawling into started bawling and crying and crying, moaning and bawling. He cried so hard that he felt as if all the tears he's cried before in his life were weren't worth crying for, to the point where he wished he could go back in time, it's all the times he's cried and slap himself across the face saying, You're not crying for anything. He felt he felt angry at himself, angry for not being there and angry for not killing Abel before this happened. He felt sort of guilty. He describes this as he's never cried as hard in his life because that was his mother. When he arrived to the hospital, Andrew was waiting there. But the whole time, Andrew was actually calm the entire time, waiting outside the room. Andrew just sat there until he saw Trevor in his tears and started bawling out hysterically as well. But Trevor describes his tears more as like a helpless kind of cry rather than Trevor's cry of like, pain and grief. The doctors told them, they were outside in a waiting room. The doctors told them that she's been sedated and there's nothing they can do. So the best thing is to go home and get rest and come back the next morning. So the main character did and first thing in the morning, he went back to visit his mom. She was bandaged in the back of her head and she had a gauze on her eye. He sat by her bed and held her head and cried and cried and kept bawling out. Eventually, his mother opened her eyes. The second she did, he lost it and he started crying again. He just kept crying and crying. Eventually, she spoke to him and said she was telling him, and saying, Don't worry, don't worry, Trevor, baby, it's okay. Trevor's saying, how can it be okay? how can I not cry? She was telling him not to cry. He was saying, How can I not cry? You're my mom, or and you've been shot? Like, I thought you were gonna die? How can I not cry? She says, Listen, Trevor, listen, there's a bright side to this. He asks, What's the bright side? You've been shot in the head? How can this be a good thing? She goes, Look on the bright side. Now you're the most attractive, good looking person in the family. He started laughing. He was crying hysterically and laughing at the same time and they were both laughing together while in the hospital room.
