Trevor got his hair done. Suddenly he started scoring dates with other girls. He didn't question his formula. He just went back to the salon every week, and spend hours getting his hair straightened and then contoured. His mother used to make fun of him because she would never date a guy who spent more time on his hair than she did. Trevor's mother would work from Monday to Saturday. But as soon as it was Sunday, she used to take a shower, and she's looked very beautiful. Her hair was like super spectacular. She used to these tell trevor it only took her a short time to have her hair done. There was this make car mechanic shop near their house. Mighty mechanics, I believe. Trevor and his mom would take their Volkswagen there. It was in the car shop like every week. Trevor was six to seven years old at the time, and he couldn't like comprehend why he was there every week, even though there was nothing wrong with the car. There was this car mechanic called Abel, who caught his mom's attention.  Abel also had a special name for the mother. Then they got married, and then they had a baby. When Travers mom went to the hospital and then came back the next week, Trevor's life didn't change much, I guess because like there's no change for a nine year old boy since he didn't have to change diapers or feed him. He just knew that there was this creature in the house that used to eat and poop all the day and cry. He used to play video games arcades and run around the neighborhood. Then one day, Trevor's brother Andrew, called him and asked him if he was busy. So he called them at 10am. Andrew asked Trevor he was busy. Trevor said no. Andrew then said that the mom had had been shot. Trevor quickly deduced that Abel shot her. He didn't think much of at that time because he sensed that Andrew was very calm over the phone. He thought that he didn't shoot a vital organ or organ or anything. Anyways, he is driving to the hospital and add a red light, I guess Trevor called Andrew and asked Where did he shoot her? Andrew said that he shot her in the leg. Then Andrew said he also shot her in the head. At that point, Trevor lost it. And he started crying, crying very badly. And then it wasn't that type of crying, rather it was a cry of being in pain. He was thinking to himself like all the times that he cried before it was nothing compared to this time and he would go back to his past self and then tell them to stop crying because it was nothing compared to this. Anyways, he started driving as soon as the light turned green. He couldn't see anything but he was still driving. As soon as he reached the hospital, he went into the emergency room and he saw Andrew standing there. As soon as they saw each other Andrew lost it. He also started crying, it was a cry of helplessness because he couldn't do anything. Anyway, both of them were talking to the doctor. Then the doctor said that there was nothing they could do and then they should go home. Take a good night's rest. The next day when they come back, so when Trevor sees the mom, he sees that her head is bandaged. Then he goes on set, sits at his at her bedside, and then one moment trevor's mother opens her eyes, and she starts crying again. He's like, bawling his eyes out. When his mother asked him for a glass of water, she gave it to her and then she was drinking it through the straw. Trevor was still crying, and then the mother shushed him up, Trevor's mother says,  why are you crying? So, he said that, of course, I'm crying, give her a shot. So and then, the mother said that while there's one good side or being shot, and then he said, like, What are you talking about? There's nothing good about getting shot. Then the mother says "of course there is". No you have better hair than me. At that sentence, both of them start laughing and they start cracking jokes.
