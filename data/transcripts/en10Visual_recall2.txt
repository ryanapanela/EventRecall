The story starts with the narrator talking about Hollywood, In the movies when someone jumps out of a car. It looks like it doesn't hurt. To the narrator it was super crazy and cool. Then he says this is not true because it hurts so bad. Then he recalls a Sunday where he fell, which started off like a normal Sunday.  His mom had made him  porridge. It was a normal day. They were headed somewhere and really wanted to go into a car. The car just wouldn't start. At that point, they didn't know what to do. His mom wanted to wait for a minivan. At that time, public transportation was only for the white people, because of the apartheid. the government didn't really care for public transportation for black people. There were routes that were unregulated with mini buses, which was kind of like organized crime with how the mini bus system ran. There were different routes that were controlled by different groups. Because it was outside of the law, the drivers were very territorial about who they picked up and what what route they picked them up at. While waiting for the minibus, which never came there, Trevor was waiting with his mom and baby Andrew. His mom decided that hitchhiking would be a better option than waiting for the bus, which was notoriously known to be very violent. This is because the transit ran without the law with their own rules. While hitchhiking eventually a driver comes by and offers them a ride. They get on and then they realize the mini bus that they were waiting for has come as well. The men that are from the mini bus route, stop that car, and they come out with weapons. These weapons used to kill people, and Smash people's heads. Two men come out, and go up to the driver accusing him of taking their riders. They start being violent. Then mom tells them that we were waiting for you and its not the driver's fault. We'll come ride with you because that's who we were waiting for. They get into the minibus and the driver keeps lecturing her and her getting lectures wasn't a new thing. She was very used to it. There are two types of women from these two different tribes one from the Zulu and then one from the Xhosa. The stereotype went that Zulu women were elegant and not promiscuous. The other tribe, Xhosa women are promiscuous and had a reputation of sleeping around. The bus driver lectures them saying, Oh, what are you doing getting into a car that's not your husband's, and then the mom claps back, and it's a lot of back and forth. The drivers are Zulu men. One realizes that  the mom like is from the enemy tribe. He also realizes that she's a mom with two kids and one that is like a mixed child. He then says other tribal women were already known as to being not promiscuous, but its worse because she sleeps with white men. The bus driver kept accusing her and degrading her. She kept fighting back. Then at the end, he says, you're gonna learn your lesson tonight. They realize the consequence of getting into this minivan could be death, because that's how violent South Africa was at the moment where Apartheid was happening. The driver is driving really fast, doesn't really stop and while the mom asks to be dropped off. He just keeps driving really fast. At this point, his mom had whispered to him saying at the next intersection, when he's slowing down, but for checking for like cars at the intersection, we're going to open the door, and we have jump out. Trevor doesn't really hear this because he's nodding off. The minivan approaches the intersection, and starts to slow down. His mom opens the door, and pushes Trevor out and then follows behind her while curling baby Andrew, to protect him as like they're jumping out of the moving car. Trevor was so disoriented and trying to get up. He saw that his mom was on her feet, ready to go. She screamed run. He and his mom ran really fast. He felt an instinct to just run and follow his mom. He remembers to run for cover and things like that. He was used to running. He and his mom ran so far that the men from the mini bus couldn't catch up to them. He jokes that they were dealing with like the champions of their sports day. They ran so fast that they got out of being seen and being followed. They eventually end up at a petrol station. They call for the police so that they can go home safely. Trevor gets really mad at his mom, at the end saying why would jesus do this to us because this was like a nightmare. When that like next time if the car doesn't work, that just means like, we shouldn't like be waiting for a mini bus. But then his mom says they we were meant to do this, since Jesus would have wanted us to like have this experience. Then trevor says no, how about you ask Jesus to meet us at home next time. Then they kind of laugh out their frustrations with each other.
