The story is about this boy, his mom and his younger brother, Andrew. They were getting ready to start the day, They were trying to go to church because it was on a Sunday. They got ready for the day, they went outside, they were trying to get in the car, but their car wouldn't start. They had to wait for the bus stop. This is during the time of segregation, because black people were not allowed on the bus. Black people made up their own transit system that was very, inconsistent and dangerous. They were waiting for the bus outside the mom and the inner two boys, but it wasn't coming. The mom suggested that they start hitchhiking. Then as they started walking for a while, another car pulled up and offered them a ride. They got in. One of the transit cars like stopped in front of the car that had offered them a ride and one of the guys came out with a club from a certain tribe. They came beside the window of the car that was picking up the family. He grabbed the man who was offering them the ride. He said why are you trying to take our passengers, but then the mom tried to calm down the situation and was like, he was just offering us a ride. We wanted to get in your car anyway. So we'll just get out. Then they got out of the car. Then they went into the transit car. The man was lecturing the woman about how she shouldn't be in the car of a man that isn't her husband. They were just kind of going back and forth. Then we find out that the man is from the Zulu tribe, and the mom is from the Xhosa tribe. The Zulu woman are regarded as like, these pristine and proper woman, while the Xhosa tribe woman are regarded as these promiscuous type of woman like unfaithful woman. The driver found out that she's from the Xhosa tribe, after she started speaking her native tongue, and then like, put the whole family in a dangerous situation, because he was implying that he was going to rape or hurt her in the car. The mother calmed down, noticing that the situation was getting dangerous and was asking the man to just let him out. She apologized to the man if she made him angered. The driver kept saying no, and he kept speeding. To her nine year old boy, she had whispered to him like, oh, when the next time the car stops, we're gonna jump out the door. But the boy was was asleep. He heard what the mom said, but he didn't process it. By the time the bus had stopped, the mom and opened up the door and threw her nine year old out the door and she held on to the baby like she kind of curled herself up and while holding the baby so that when she jumped out of the bus, the baby wouldn't get hurt. Then the nine year old boy like wasn't processing what had happened, since he just had gotten thrown out of the bus. Then the mom started running and told the boy to start running as well, because the men in the bus were trying to chase after them.  They were pretty bewildered by what had happened, because they didn't think that they, that whole situation would happen. Then the family starts running away, and the bus drivers like, they try running after them, but they give up after a while, and then they run the family runs to a petrol station, and they call the police. The men had left, so they were pretty far gone by that point. When the police had come to drive them back home, the boy had processed what had happened and was like asking his mom, why did you throw me out of the car out of the bus? And she had told him, I did tell you, but you were asleep, like, should I have left you there to die? Then they just kept going, like back and forth. And then the mom was like, Thank God that we had gotten out of that alive. Then the boy was like, No, this is not thanks to God. Like, if anything, this was the devil because we should have stayed home after we realized that the car wasn't starting. They kind of had this like back and forth religious talk, and then after a while, they kind of both calmed down and just started laughing on their way back home.
