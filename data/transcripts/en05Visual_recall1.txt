Trevor starts off by saying that in the movies, whenever people are being thrown from a car, it's usually eventful, and they run out of a car, then dust themselves off and continue about their day. The day that he got thrown out of a car on a Sunday or something like that started off as any other typical Sunday. Then he explains that his mom made him porridge. They were getting ready to leave the house. He had a little brother, I don't remember if that was mentioned, right at this point and they were getting ready for the day. They all loaded up into the car to leave for the day. But the car didn't start. Instead of taking the car, they waited. The brother was in a car seat or something, maybe that's what they talked about. But they waited, and they decided to wait for a minibus. They described at this point that they're black. In this society, black people aren't allowed to take a regular bus. So they have minibuses. These mini buses are ran by organized crime. The reason why they have the mini buses is because of necessity. Despite the blacks not being allowed on normal buses, they still need to get around to sweep and mop up white people's homes. That's where the mini bus business started from. But because it's an unregulated, illegal business, a lot of the people who run the mini bus companies are like gangsters. There's territory wars, technically over who can drive buses, what routes people are allowed to take. And they're generally unreliable. So people who take mini buses are not surprised if the buses don't show up at all. Sometimes they never come. They just go on to explain more about the legality and the territory and the routes, and how the drivers are typically not always great people. They're waiting for the mini bus and it never shows. Then, after a while, his mom says, Let's hitch hike. So they walk a bit, and then someone slows down a car to pick them up and offers them a ride. So they get into that car. After driving for a little while in that car, a mini bus pulls up and cuts them off. The mini bus driver comes out and brings out a weapon that had a cultural name. But it's basically used to bash people skulls in. Its a Zulu weapon or bat and used to bash people's skulls in. He comes out of a car and comes and starts to walk towards them. His lackey comes out of a car as well. Both of them are approaching over the minibus and both of them are approaching the car. They're getting upset claiming like why are you driving people that could be in our mini bus on our route and are basically threatening the driver and Trevor's mom speaks up and is like no, don't get into it with the driver we'll come ride with you. That's what you wanted anyways, right? They ended up getting out of the car, and de escalating the situation by going into their mini bus instead of the car. Once they're in the minibus, the guy starts talking and I guess he's angry about the situation. Trevor points out that typically these drivers are known for haggling and harassing the people who are there driving around and the drivers coming from not necessarily great backgrounds and being part of this not necessarily regulated scene sometimes not great people. He is going at her talking about how she shouldn't have been in a car with a man when she's married, or when she has children. She shouldn't be in a car with a man who's not her husband willy nilly like that. His mom instead of kind of just letting it go, is not one to take lectures from random men. She told him to mind your business, essentially. That made him more angry. It just kept on escalating and escalating. It came out somehow that she is from something called Xhosa. And he's Zulu. And apparently, their stereotypes around Zulu women versus Xhosa women. Similarly, how they have stereotypes about the men as well. But in terms of the stereotypes towards the women, the idea is that Zulu women are, you know, they do their duty, and they're quieter, and they're respectful. Versus Xhosa women, who are whores and promiscuous. Once he finds that out, he was like, oh, okay, I see what you are, especially the fact that she also had two kids. Not only is she a Xhosa woman who already has all of these negative stereotypes, but she's also a woman who has a mixed child therefore sleeps with white men. So she's a whore. She's also a whore who sleeps with white men is what he was getting at. That made him increasingly angry, he continued to berate them, his mom continued to fight back with him, and not kind of let him get away with the comments. He reached a point where he was like, you know, waving his finger in the rearview mirror and just talking and talking and talking. And the mom increased his anger. So then, he was threatening them, and then started speeding in the mini bus and driving in this particular direction, and going really fast and only slowing down at intersections, just to look very quickly before proceeding through the intersection. The mom recognized the threat and was worried that this driver was going to kill them. So she starts trying to reason with him and being like, why don't we talk about this? It doesn't have to be this way. He kept on interrupting her sentences and being like, no, no, no, not reasoning with her anymore. So the mom eventually stops trying to reason with him, and goes over to Trevor, who at this point was already falling asleep. Even earlier in the story, he talked about how they waited so long for the mini bus that he basically fell asleep while standing on his feet. So obviously, Trevor was tired. He was falling asleep as well and wasn't privy to everything that was going on. In Trevor's mind, he's not really understanding the situation. Even though his mom leaned over to him and said, Trevor at the next intersection, when he slows down, we're gonna jump out. He didn't hear that because he was half asleep and didn't process what she had said. By the time the next intersection came and the driver slowed down, the mom went, leaned over, opened the car door, and pushed him out, and then jumped out after him. Trevor says that he didn't realize what was going on until he hit the floor, and like, there was a bang sound, and then he realized what was happening. Adrenaline kicked in, and his mom said to run, so they ran. And they ran really quickly. They kept running, even though he was like, you know, not necessarily noticing the pain, but recognize what was going on. The drivers came out to go after them, but they were just running too fast. Even the drivers were shocked that this mom and her baby and a kid were able to outrun them. And Trevor says that, you know, for them, they know that when people say run, you run, especially because they live in a type of society where they have to do a lot of running away from things. He doesn't ask questions, he knows that when someone says run you run because it's for the best. So they ran and ran. Then they got to a gas station, a local petrol station, and then that's when they called the police. Then, at that point, the mini bus drivers were long gone. It was at that point that I guess he realized, like, what was going on and what had happened and that he was, you know, covered in dirt, scrapes, and cuts, and that his mom was as well. But luckily, the baby Andrew, his little brother was okay, because his mom wrapped herself around him before jumping out. So he, surprisingly came out unscathed. They got to the petrol station, they called the police. He looked at his mom, like, what the hell was that? He's realizing what happened. He was like, Why didn't she warned me? Why did you just push me out of the car? And why didn't you say jump kind of thing. And his mom was like, I did tell you. He was like, I didn't get that because I was half asleep. So I didn't realize what was going on. They have a little bit of a back and forth about that. Then his mom says Thank God, we're okay. Trevor goes, no, don't thank God, because we shouldn't have been in the situation basically, in the first place. She starts to say something about how Oh, no, it's God's will. And then he's like, it's not God's will. if this is God's will, we should have listened this morning when the car wouldn't have started. We shouldn't have gone out because the devil is involved in this somehow. She says, No, that's not how the devil works. And then they basically get into a conversation arguing about God's will. This makes it seem like maybe they've had previous arguments about God's will and what that means.  They start laughing about something and then hte wrap up the scene by saying, you know, here they are laughing about the situation covered in cuts at a petrol station in the middle of the night, waiting for the police to come.
