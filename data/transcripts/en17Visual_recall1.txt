In Hollywood, there are always these dramatic scenes where a person is jumps out of a moving car or thrown out. They roll out and they're completely unscathed. He was talking about how that's not the most realistic because he's actually been thrown out of a moving car. He starts the story about how his mother had gotten up in the morning, made him porridge, with his younger brother, Andrew, who was nine months old at the time, and  getting them all ready. Then when they went to leave the house, Their car wouldn't start. Then they were going to take the bus. The mini bus was a because of racial segregation and restrictions on using public transportation. White people still need to have their houses cleaned. They needed transport. Mini buses became a thing. The informal system had specific routes, and it was a, he referenced that it was like organized crime, because if routes were taken, violence would happen. They were also really inconsistent. They had waited for a while, and then decided that they were just going to try to hitchhike, the mom suggested that they should hitchhike. Then they're able to get a car and they start driving. This mini bus cuts the car off, and comes out with this club and threatens them. Somebody comes out of the driver's seat, and threatening them. They say that "you're taking your customers taking the route". The mom says, "oh, no, it's okay. I wanted to go with you guys". We want to go with you guys. We'll just come with you. We were just waiting for whatever. They all go. The narrator, his mom, just younger brother, go into the minibus, then they're moving along. The driver was a bit nasty, and was making comments about the mom was traveling with someone who wasn't her husband. The mom tells the driver to shut his mouth. But she said it in one language, I think, Zulu. But basically, there are two prominent languages. The driver spoke Zulu. Zulu women, were are kind of more quiet and subservient. While the language that his mom was speaking was from a different culture. He started calling her like a slut and arguing with the mom saying comments about her because of the language that she used. Then he says, Oh, I'm going to I'm going to show and he starts driving really quickly. It's a really dangerous situation. The mom says to her son, the narrator, that at the next stoplight, She's going to try to get the door open, and then he's going to have to jump out, but he was really tired. He was just trying to fall asleep, He didn't realize how much danger they were in because his mom remained calm, even though it was not a calm situation. It slows down, then the mom ends up just throwing him out. She grabs her younger son, who's like nine months old, and covers him. The baby didn't get injured at all. As soon as they land she just yet tells him to run. He knew that it was not the time for questions. He just ran with his mom. Although the car like stopped and people got out and tried to chase them, they were no match for them. They went really far until they found the gas station, and then they called the police. By then it was too far gone. At the gas station, he realized that his leg was  hurt. His mom said, thank God. He got frustrated, Trevor then said if God was giving a sign, it would have been that the car the tires are messed up or something. It might have been the sign from God that we should have stayed home today. It ends with the narrator making a bit of a joke about how they're both alive.
