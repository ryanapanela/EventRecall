The narrator begins by describing how in Hollywood movies, you'll see people jumping out of a car or getting thrown from a moving vehicle and how they just get up, unfazed. The narrator says that it must hurt a lot more to get thrown out of a moving car like that. He goes on to describe one day they were waiting to go to school and the car wouldn't start. So then they were waiting for a minibus. Under the apartheid government in South Africa, there was no public transportation provided for black people. So the groups provided their own transportation in the form of minibuses, but they were basically organized crime run by rival gangs. And when driver couldn't take another drivers route, as that was considered stealing, and oftentimes, people would get killed for that. So they're waiting for the minibus and the narrator is so tired, and he's falling asleep. Their mom decides they should try hitchhiking. So eventually, someone picks them up and they get in his car. But as soon as they pull out the road, a minibus comes up behind them with Zulu men with spears. The spears were described for bashing people's heads in. So they threaten to hurt the man, they'd say, why are you stealing our customers? And so the narrator's mom says, It's okay. They get into the minibus. And the mini bus driver starts harassing her and saying, Why did you get in a car with a random man. And he hears her speaking in Xhosa, which is the rival group. The narrator describes the stereotypes about Zulu women, and  How Zulu women are seen as faithful, but Xhosas seen as more promiscuous. The driver keeps yelling and being cruel to his mother, as they go on and eventually says he's going to teach them a lesson. So it's the narrator and his mother and his baby brother Andrew in the minibus, and they're the only passengers. His mother leans over and whispers to him, when the driver slows down at the next stop, she's going to open the door and they're all going to jump out. The narrator is asleep, so he doesn't hear. When the driver does slow down. The mom opens the door and pushes out the narrator. She jumps out as well holding the baby brother. They get out and he's confused. In shock, but she says run and they and they start running. The mini drifts bus driver tries to chase them. But they are running really fast. This is Because they have experience living in the violent neighborhoods and having to run from the police in riot gear. The narrator describes that they eventually run to a gas station and are able to call the police. By then the men are gone. the narrator asked his mom why and she tells him they were going to kill them. He didn't understand that she had just saved his life. Eventually, they just start laughing. And they're both covered in scratches and bleeding. Covered in dirt but they're laughing in the gas station. Together.
