The story is about a boy called Trevor, he was a black person. And in a school there were three Chinese kids that transferred there and they were the only ones out of thousands of people. One was Bolo, and there was Bruce Lee, And John. Bolo got his nickname because he looked like a movie star. Bruce Lee's name was actually just Bruce lee which made  his life. He was fit, which made it even more ironic. And John was just John, which was weird. Bolos parents worked as pirates, they pirated CDs and sold them in the flea market. So bolo did the same thing. He would pirate video games, take kids PlayStations, bring them home, and bring it back a few days later sell them with video games embedded in it. Then, a kid named Andrew joined the business. He was a few years older than them. They started working together, Bolo and Andrew. They were selling CDs and Playstations. however, Trevor overheard them while he was working, and that they were complaining about the black kids that were paying for their services. So Trevor went ahead and interjected and told them that he could be the middleman he would still help them sell their service and ensure that the money is back. and in return, he would get a cut of their sales. Bolo and Andrew both liked the idea and and they instantly started working together as partners. Trevor got his job done, and he started making this share of money, which allowed him to buy his own computer parts, upgrade his old parts.  Andrew would teach him where to get the cheapest part and how to put them together. He was always missing a CD reader. For him, black people, didn't ever get to use computers and a CD writer was way out of reach. It was just pure fantasy. So getting there was an absolute dream. Then Bolo left the school. It was alleged that his parents were arrested. So he left the school altogether. And it was all down to Andrew and Trevor himself. Ultimately, Andrew was paranoid, So he also quit the business. But Andrew thanked him for being such a good business partner, and gave him a CD reader, which Trevor was over the moon about. Trevor now works alone and thinks he's in the Big League. He makes a lot of money, just by pirating different CDs and selling them. He didn't really know much about music. However since his mom never really allowed anything other than Christian music, Christian music was the only type of music he understood. He doesn't really ever listen to the music, the pirates. He said that to not get high on his own supply. He didn't really judge people's music taste. If you want anything, he would just copy it and sell it to you. Then eventually, he got two middlemen. One of them came up to him and proposed a new idea and he said it would make him a lot of money. It was to combine different songs of different albums, taking the best songs of different albums and putting them together since people only wanted to listen to the songs they liked. Trevor liked the idea started doing it which got him a lot more money in sales. Trevor was doing really well financially. He would have one of those big block phones. Since cellphones weren't a thing back then. Who would walk down the street, walk into McDonald's, get his meal while talking on the phone. Trevor's business partner got another idea by fading songs together to make it sound seamless. Trevor liked the idea yet again. He thought it was like a DJ, mixing songs all together. Those also did well in sales. Suddenly he became quite a good pirater. he thinks he's doing very well. suddenly he thanks Andrew for everything that he's gotten him by giving him his first CD reader, which allowed him to do what he's doing, then showing him the ins and outs of business by running a small pirating business. He also uses the analogy of giving a man a fish and he eats for a day and teaching a man how to fish and he fishes forever. He criticizes the analogy by saying that it'd be nice if you get the man a fishing rod before. He uses the analogy to say that most black people struggle with resources. Since the poor always get lectured to take care of themselves and take responsibility. However, they don't have the resources to do so. Andrew really showed him that even with talent, he couldn't have gone anywhere without Andrew since Andrew was a white dude with a white family. So things Andrew took for granted, Trevor worked hard to get. Trevor credits Andrew for most of his success and that he wouldn't have stood a chance without Andrew giving him the resources that's needed for him to run his business.
