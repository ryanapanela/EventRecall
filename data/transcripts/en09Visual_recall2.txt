The story started with the narrator talking about the one time that he got cornrows. Girls started to like him. He seemed pleased with the result and then started taking care of his hair more spending, a lot of hours on his hair. His mom would tease him by saying she would never both a man that spends more time on his hair than she does. Then whenever his mom would get dressed, she would compare him to herself and say, she just took a shower and spent four hours taking care of himself. They seem to be really friendly and make fun of themselves. The have a really good mother son relationship. Then the narrator said there's only two men that his mom has ever been with, which was his dad and his stepfather. One of them had the name Abel. I'm not sure which one. I think it was the father because it seemed like the first marriage she had was still Abel. Then the marriage was not a ceremony but just a certificate like signing a contract. Nothing special. Then he was nine. At some point, his mom got pregnant with his younger brother, which he was nine years older than. He just went on with his own life. He never really had to take care of the brother but instead focus on his media business like podcasts and hosting. One time he was called on 10am in the morning while he was in bed by his brother. his brother told him that his mother had been shot. He thought it was his brother that shot his mother. He said his brother was really stoic, calm and collected. Then he seemed really scared. He jumped out of his bed and then jumped into his car. He started driving. While he was driving.  He said his mom would call his dad able or abby while he would call her Umblee- there was a longer form of that name. On the way there in the car, he called his brother to get more details about what happened to his mom. His brother narrated the story. They were going home from church. Abel apparently was handsome, but he wasn't good looking. It was the kind of ugly that women liked. That's why it's mom would say. He was muscular. He worked out. He was a mechanic. He was about six when they met and start to be seen around more. On his way to his mom, Andrew narratted the story, they were on their way home after church, and abel got out of his car. and started shooting at them. He shot her in the knee in or the leg, he said. this made the narrator happy. But then he was told that she was actually shot in the head, which was devastating for the narrator. He was crying a lot. He said if he could go back and in time, he would have told his other past self that you these are not things worth crying about because he seemed really devastated by this event. When he got there, he saw his brother was stoic, just sitting. But when his brother raised his head, they both started crying. Then they hugged each other. And then they both went to a small room. He grabbed her hand, he sat her nose, left eye and the back of her head was bandaged. He just held her hand and he was told to go back home and then humans brother went back home and then they came back the next day it turns out his mom was stable. So he came back the next day. Same thing. He held his mom's hand and then his mom actually woke up. She opened her unblinded her eye, she asked for water, which he gave her. He started crying a lot more. She told him to shush and that it was fine. But it was not actually fine because he thought she actually died. Then she said that  there's at least like one bright side to this, which was that he is now the best looking person in the family because she would say she was. Then they both laughed at that joke.
