I talks about his cornrows. It was the first time that he's ever gotten attention from girls. He started going on dates He keep going back to the salon, and work really hard to get his hair done. It would take a really long time which his mother rolled her eye upon, as she said, she would never go on a date with a guy that takes so long with his hair. His mother was a beautiful woman, as he said, but she would never do what he does. She drags herself through Monday to Saturday, on a garden dress that was dirty. But only on Sunday, when she goes to church. She was like a million dollars. And she can't help but tease him. She would say stuff like who was the most attractive person in the family now and I hope you enjoyed your six days of being attractive. The writer knew her mother was attractive. He said that no one would like to talk about how attractive their mother was, no matter if it was on the inside or outside. And he was sure that has broken many of hearts before he was there. But since his birth, there was only two men that were in her life. His father and his stepfather. In his stepfathers home, he is a mechanic shop and he will always go there to fix her Volkswagen since it broke down a lot. There was a mechanic there at Abel. he was always there. He was strong. He was handsome. He was handsome but not good looking. they were often there because their car always broke down. Eventually they started going even when the car didn't break down. His mother liked him because he wasn't good looking, but he was handsome. He was a good type of ugly as she said. And soon they got married. But there are no ceremonies, not weddings, no exchange of rings, they just went and signed the papers. And soon they got a kid. His mom came back crying. But for the nine year old writer, nothing really changed. He was still out there playing with his frieds, not changing diapers. later down the line, he became a comedian. He was touring the world doing different types of shows. But in the middle of nowhere, his brother called and calmly told him that his mom's been shot. But it was kind of weird for the writer since he didn't start with my mom's been shot. Rather than where are you? How are you? Which is confusing for the writer. The writer did not have to ask who shot mom because he already knew it was Abel. So he quickly asked where they were. And his little brother said in the hospital still very calmly. He knocked on his roommate door and told him that his mom has ben shot, so they both ran to their cars and drove quickly. So then he called his brother again in the car as they were driving down to the hospital. It was only 15 minutes away. Since his brother was so calm when he talked, he thought his Mom would be fine. his brother told him that their mom's been shot on the leg and the head. He was first relieved, but when his brother said the head he started bawling his eyes out. His brother also said that it was his dad. They were on their way to church where his dad was waiting outside and started shooting. So then he was bawling his eyes out while his brother was still kind of calm. Just crying a lot. he was angry at himself, the police, and his brother for being so calm. When he got there, he saw his brother, smothered in blood. Once his little brother saw him crying, he started bawling his eyes out too. His little brother's tears was of helplessness whereas his was in sadness and anger. When he got in the room, his mother was completely bandaged up. The back of her head was ugly. He bawling his eyes out holding her arm crying, thinking he has lost his mother. It has always been the two of them against the world, but now he has lost her. Doctors told them to leave. They told them that her mom was was stable. So on the next day, when they came back, her mom opened one of her eyes, that was bandaged. She saw the writer weeping since she opened her eye. The writer's mom told him to stop crying and to look at the bright side. the writer responded and  said he can't stop crying because he thought he almost lost her. How could there be a bright side? But then his mom said, well, now you're officially the prettiest person in the house. And they both started laughing. In the hospital in sunny bright day.
