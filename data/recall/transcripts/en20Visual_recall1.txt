Trevor talks about his mother, and how she's very beautiful, without even trying. He would get his hair done at the salon every week just to look nice. To look handsome for all the girls. His mother didn't even have to try, she would be working in the garden with mud all over her face, wearing worn clothing and still look very beautiful. On Sundays, she would get ready for church and get her hair done her makeup done and everything, and she would look very, very beautiful. When he was maybe six or seven years old, he and his mother would go to the auto shop, a couple of blocks away from his father's home. This auto shop was run by a mechanic named Abel. They ended up going to the auto shop a lot. It felt like they were just going to the auto shop when there was nothing even wrong with the car. And eventually his mother took a liking to Abel. They eventually got married. And about a year later or so they had a baby. And so Trevor now had a little brother. As the years went by, you know, Trevor was a comedian doing shows and tours all over the world. On one morning, he got a call from his mother's phone. And he picked it up and it was his brother Andrew. They had a brief conversation before Andrew tells Trevor that their mother has been shot. And Trevor was very, very intrigued as to why Andrew sounded calm, so calm during the conversation, but also the fact that he himself, never asked Andrew who shot their mother. He already knew that it was Abel his stepfather who had shot his mother. He immediately got up and drove over to the hospital, which his mother was being treated for her wounds. One instance, he was wondering how his mother was doing. He called Andrew again at a traffic light. he asked her what happened exactly. Coming back from church that day,  everything seemed perfectly fine. When they got home, Abel was there. Abel just took out a gun and started shooting at their mother. The first shot hit her in the leg. The second one hit her in the head. At that exact same traffic light he after he heard those words, Trevor started bawling crying his eyes out, describing it as crying like he's never done before it was out of raw pain, emotional pain, not just out of sadness, or anything like that. It was just out of raw pain that he, he couldn't even control. It was the only way that he could respond. When the traffic light  turned green, he kept going, and ended up making it to the hospital. His brother looked at first calm, but as soon as his brother Andrew saw him, he started crying his own eyes out. They embraced each other. Trevor could sense that Andrew was crying out of helplessness, like what is he going to do now? With with their mom's life at risk. Trevor tries to go into the ER room, but the doctors directs them away, saying, you know, there's nothing you can do right now. We just gotta let her rest. They go home for the night, but then Trevor is back there in the morning, the next day, and he's sitting beside his mother. While she's on the ER, recovering, he's just thinking to himself why this happened. why did why did his mother deserve this? Suddenly his mother opened her eyes, and he started crying again. He was so so glad that she was okay. His mother was able to say a few words and say, Oh, honey, you don't cry. Why are you crying? And, and told them to look at the bright side? And he was wondering, like, What do you mean? Like, what is the bright side? You just got shot, your life was at risk. And she's like, Oh, now at least, you're the best looking person in the family. They just sat there crying and laughing in the ER. And that's the end of the story.
