When trevor was in grade nine, three Chinese kids have transferred to high school. They were Bolo, Bruce Lee and John. they were the only Chinese kids in high school so bolo got his nickname because of this movie, Bloodsport. Bruce Lee's name was like actually Bruce Lee, which made their lives easy. John was also just John which was weird because both of them had like unique names. Bolo's parents were professional pirates. They pirated video games and sold them at the market to which like Bolo followed in their footsteps. He used to take everybody's Playstations, put some pirated games in them, and make a good buck out of it. Bolo was friends with this white kid, whose name was Andrew, and he used to pirate music. He also had a CD writer. What they did was basically team up. One day, they were complaining about the black kids at that school, as they never paid them back. Trevor says it's fine, because the black people don't have enough money. He proposed that, that they should give him the merchandise, and then he would and then he would sell them to other people. They liked the idea right away, and then the three of them became business partners. With this money, Trevor was able to add memory to his computer. Anyway, He was the middleman and was enjoying it. He was enjoying, his life. And he used to buy the most expensive CD writers and everything. One day, Andrew had to drop out and and then he went away. Trevor got the writers and everything, and that's when everything started. Everyone went to him to copy the music that they wanted. They used to give him the music that they want. The next day he would donate back. He would buy the CDs in the market for like 100 to 150 Rand, whereas he sold them for three grand I believe, which is like, sorry, 30 rand, which is like $3. Of course everybody went to him. As his business grew bigger. He bought new stuff. If he started buying stuff, he had a wonderful router. He also said the CD writer was so old that it took him like five to six hours to properly complete like complete copying all of the songs. Therefore, he had to buy a new CD writer as well. He had so much money he even bought a cell phone. During that time buying a cell phone was like a privilege because nobody else had. Now, if you went down the street to the McDonald's, he could take his cell phone and talk in it, and speak on it, and then the other people would see him you know, talking on the phone. He did recognize that he owed all of his success to Andrew. Okay. Then he also states that he also states Andrews background as well. Andrew was from a very rich background, where all the people in his like family went to schools and universities.
