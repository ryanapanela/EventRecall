The main character had three Chinese boys who transferred to their school. Out of 1000 students, three were Chinese students. Their names were Bolo, Bruce Lee, and John. Bruce Lee was good looking and resembled Bruce Lee. To the students, it was like, "Thank God that were were sent Bruce Lee". Bolo had two parents who were pirates that pirated video games, movies and CDs. Bolo naturally made that his own business at school selling video games, and CDs to other students. He was also friends with a boy named Andrew who was two grades above the main character. Andrew was white, and was also in the pirating business. The main character knew bolo because he was one of his tuckshop clients and so Bolo and Andrew would sell their merchandise at school for cheaper prices, getting students to give them their Playstations. He would then pirate video games onto it so the students could have access to that game. Andrew was a geek and had his own CD writer which no one had back then. One day, the main character heard Bolo and Andrew talking about or complaining about black students and how they would receive merchandise from them. They would tell them that they would all pay pay back later, and then they wouldn't pay them. Bolo and Andrew were scared of black kids, so they couldn't do anything about it. The main character being black, offered to be a middleman and offered to sell the merchandise for the two and get the payments back for a small cut of their sales. Andrew and Bolo were happy about this and agreed, and sales were going good. The main character was a middleman for the two. They were saving up a lot of money, or the main character was saving up a lot of money and making a lot. Until one day Andrew left the school after an rumors spread that his parents were arrested due to the pirating. They were going to continue the business until Andrew decided that he wanted to quit the game and gave Trevor a CD writer of his own. To the main character that was like huge, because back then black people didn't have access to that they didn't have access to CD writers, let alone computers. So to him that changed everything. And so from then on, the main character, started his own pirating business where he would sell, write his own CDs, and sell them the CD writer that Andrew gave him was a one time speed so it would record at the speed that it played. So he would come home after school and wait five to six hours for one whole album. And although he burned a lot of discs or made a lot of CDs, he never actually listened to them himself. He wasn't that big into music, and he only listened to Christian music because that's all his mother would allow in the house. He never judged people for their music state music tastes either. He made CDs with DMX and Nirvana and you never judge people for what they were listening to. Eventually he saved up so much to the point where he was able to afford his own cordless telephone, where he was even able to set his or the base of the telephone at his house and walk two blocks to the nearest McDonald's, and order his law large number one, and come back while on the telephone with his friend. He credits this all to Andrew, who started this all and gave him his CD writer and began this for him. Also, the main character is a natural businessman so business came easily to him. He also recognizes that the importance of the privileged. Andrew as a privileged and white man, coming from a white family who had access to education, knowledge and resources, helping the oppressed black people who are disenfranchised, and didn't have access to these things. Andrew helped Trevor in starting this business for himself and enabling him to do what he's doing. It's an example of how sometimes you need the privilege to come and help you out. And the main character notes that some people believe that it's like a handout, but he believes that there's still a lot of work that he has to put in despite being helped by the privileged and that without this help, talent alone would have never made it.
