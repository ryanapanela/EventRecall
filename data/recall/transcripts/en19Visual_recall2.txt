The person is telling the story was on the ninth grade three kids had transferred in from China. One was bolo, and he was named from this really popular movie. The second kid was named Bruce Lee. And then the third kid's name was John. Bolo's Parents were pirating a lot of movies and media. Bolo was also doing something like that where he would sell kids free games on their consoles. Then he made friends with bolo that was two grades older than them named Andrew. Andrew would sell CDs I believe that were something like bootleg something CDs, since he had a CD writer at home. One day, Bolo and Andrew were complaining about how some of the black kids at school who wouldn't pay them when  they said that they would pay them later. The narrator says that he can help them if you guys give me a cut of the money. The team was bolo, Andrew and the person that's telling the story. Bolo ended up moving. There was a rumor that his parents got arrested for pirating. Andrew and the person telling the story were left and they were making a lot of money from it. Later on, Andrew ended up gifting  the person who was telling the story, his CD writer, because like, he was grateful that he had helped them so much to get to the level of selling illegal stuff that they were at. The CD writer was, I think, 2000 Rand. That's why the person who was telling the story was so grateful, because they would have never been able to get it themselves if it wasn't for Andrew. So they started making their own business and mixing CDs and stuff. But the person wasn't too knowledgeable about music, because the only music that they were allowed to listen to at home was Christian music because of his mom. Eventually, his business started growing a lot more. He ended up recruiting two middlemen. I don't remember their names, but one of them suggested that he should start making CD mixes of all of the songs, so that that would sell more. Then they started doing that, and that was selling a lot more. Then one of those middlemen said that you should figure out a way to fade the music in between each other. So there's not like a harsh cut between every song. Then the person had downloaded a program called beats per minute BPM that would help with that. That started selling a lot as well. He started selling them at parties, and stuff. He was like a DJ, making these album mixes. He would also go home and start doing the mixes because they would take so long, the CD writer would only be able to write as long as the song could go. If the song was three minutes, then the CD writer would take three minutes to put the song on the CD. There was this one popular album that took a whole day to do so the person would, right after school start doing start using the program to like, I guess burn the CDs. Near the end, they made so much money that they were able to get a cordless phone. He was able to go outside or do something at McDonald's walk down the block and still be able to hold a conversation all the way back home. He the only person that around that really had a phone like that, because they said they had a phone before everyone else was really able to have one. Towards the end, we're talking about how it doesn't matter if people have talent or not, if you're not given the tools to utilize those talents, then it's kind of wasteful. They were they made a reference to this quote that was like, if you give a man a fishing rod, if you give a man a fish, they'll be able to eat for one day, if you teach a man how to fish, they'll be able to eat fish for a lifetime. But people fail to mention that it'd be great if you gave him in a fishing rod because then they'd be able to actually do the task. The person was just thankful to Andrew, for giving him this done the CD writer, because they would have never been able to get to the level that they were at. The protagonist was black, and Andrew was white. And they were talking about how Andrew's family had so many resources and opportunities that they take for granted.
