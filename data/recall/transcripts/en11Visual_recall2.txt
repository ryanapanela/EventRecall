The narrator talks about three Chinese kids that transferred to school. Their names were Bolo, Bruce Lee and John. Bolo was also a guy. Bruce Lee's name was actually Bruce Lee, which everyone thought was very funny. Bruce lee was also fit and good looking. John was just john. Bolo had a business of selling pirated games. People would give him their PlayStations, he'd bring him back home, get a chip, and then apply pirated games to it. He makes money off of it. The Chinese kids were scared of the black kids and couldn't say anything when the black kids wouldn't pay them. The kids would say "I'll pay later" and then they never would. The Chinese kids didn't like doing business with them. The narrator says "hey, man, look us black kids. We don't have any money. But let me be your middleman. And I'll get you the money but you'll give me a discounted price." That worked. He started working with Bolo and his partner Andrew, who was described as a white kid who was working with them. The narrator started working for them and making lots of money. But then Bolo went away because his parents got arrested. But Andrew is still there. Andrew decided he wanted to like give the business to Trevor. He gave the narrator a CD writer, which apparently costed a lot back then. With this CD writer, the narrator was able to make CDs for people, which he sold for a lot cheaper than stores. Then he sold a lot. Then one day, he had another friend that said to put more songs onto one disc and that it would sell for more. Then the narrator started making mix CDs. He also talked about how he got a lot of parts from Abel's garage for making his Knick Knacks. He started making mix CDs, and then other CDs. He then talks a lot about the technicalities of CDs. He had a lot of money to the point where he could get a cordless phone, which was crazy expensive back then, which was wild at the time. He says how it was all thanks to Andrew. Then he talked about how Andrew was white. He had access to resources, education, and money. Then the narrator talks about how while his people were in huts, singing two times two equals four, they didn't have resources. The narrator says if you teach a man to fish, he'll never have to buy fish again but also to give him a fishing rod. If you don't have the resources, you can't really start. He talks about thanking Andrew because he's grateful for the CD writer. He would have never been able to do what he did.
