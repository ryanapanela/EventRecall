The narrator started getting cornrows to get ready for the matric dance.  That caused him to be able to have a lot more dates and more girls were interested in him. He would think it was because he looked really good. Other times he thought, it was because the girls realized that he was putting in as much pain into looking good as they did. He went to the salon every week, many times. His mother said that she wouldn't date someone who takes care of his hair more than she does, or spends more time looking good than she does. Then he talks about how his mother, Monday through Saturday, looked homeless, because she'd spend time in the office then spend time in the garden and didn't have time to really look good and take care of her beauty. But on Sunday, which was when they went to church, she would take a shower and wear a nice dress and pretty heels. she would look beautiful. She said that he needed four hours in the salon to look good and all she needed was a shower to look beautiful. It would kind of be a joke. He would say that he like it's not supposed to talk about your mother being hot, but that she was beautiful. Even when her mother worked in the garden and would be really muddy or do anything, She still looked beautiful. He said that she probably broke a lot of hearts in her days, but that the minute he was born, there was only two men in her life. His father and his stepfather Abel. Then he talks about how his mother met Abel. Their car would break down a lot, so they would go to the magic mechanic store. Abel was an auto mechanic working there, and that's how they met. They got married. She would use a nickname called Abi to has like a pet as a nickname for him for Abel and he would call her Myubi, which was a nickname for her name. When they got married, they just signed papers. They didn't have an exchange of rings or any ceremony. A year later his brother Andrew was born. It didn't really change his life. He was nine years older. He wasn't changing diapers. He was playing an arcades and life went on. He didn't really have to change. Yeah, he didn't have to change diapers or anything. life went on after that. He became a comedian. And he was touring in England. Then he got a call from what he thought was his mother's phone number. When he answered, it was actually his brother Andrew on the phone. Andrew asked him how he is and if he's busy. This person said no. Then Andrew said that their mother had been shot. At first, this person was like, Why didn't you say that at the start? I mean, he didn't actually say this to Him. But He thought this. Why did his brother say how are you and all these things when their mother had been shot. That should have been the first thing that Andrew had said that's what he thought.  Andrew said that they were in Linksfield hospital. This person went in their car and also told somebody else who lived with him that his mother had been shot. He got into the car and raced quickly to the hospital. This person asked how their mother get shot and what happened once he was in the car. Andrew explained to him that they had just come back from church. The father was waiting for them at home. The father got out of the car and started shooting her. The person asked to where was their mother shot, and Andrew said that she was shot in the leg. So he thought it was okay. Then he said, and then their mother was shot in the head. That's when he panicked and got really worried. He remembers that he still recalls the traffic light he was under when he heard that and time stood still. He thought that his mother was dead. He was just sobbing and panicking. He kicked himself for all the other times he cried over little things and he wished he could have told his past self that all those things he was crying about meant nothing compared to this big thing that is actually worth crying about. All he thought was he needs to get there and get to the hospital quickly. When he arrived, he saw Andrew. this whole time Andrew has remained quite calm, even explaining how their mother got shot. he was described as being perfectly calm. But the minute that he saw his brother, Andrew allowed  himself to break down. This person recalls that, while his crying was something of pain and anger, his Brother Andrews crying was something of helplessness. Then the doctors came and said that their mother was stable, and that they should go home and get some rest. So they did. Then the next morning, this person came and sat by their mother, and questioned why she was in this condition. He was angry at God and the world because she would pray all the time and out of everyone. She doesn't deserve to have a life like this and be in this condition. He also was so mad for all the times the police was called on Abel and they didn't arrest him. This led to his mother being in this condition and possibly dying. The mother has stitches in her head. And one of her eyes are bandaged, I think, but the other unbandaged eye opens. That's when he starts sobbing and is crying and is so happy that his mother is alive. She says Don't cry. Don't be upset. And he's like, How can I not cry like when this has happened to you? Then the mother cracks a joke and says, Well, now you can be the most good looking in this family. She also said something about this at the start when she would get ready on Sunday mornings and would look really beautiful. She would say now I'm the best, most good looking person in this family because she looks so beautiful for church on Sunday. It's like a comparison to when he would get his cornrows but she would still look beautiful just from a shower on Sunday. The joke ties again into the ending where she cracks this joke and he can't help but laugh while he's crying. That now she says that now you can be the most good looking one of the family. She says this to her son, the person who's narrating the story.
