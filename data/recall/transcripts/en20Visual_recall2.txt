Trevor first talks about how being thrown out of a car, and  landing on the pavement in Hollywood action movies. It looks lik it doesn't hurt. In reality, its very painful. He briefly mentions how he got hurled out of a car or a moving vehicle on a Sunday. That Sunday, him and his baby brother and his mother, were getting ready to go somewhere. They were trying to get their car started. It wouldn't start and so they decided to wait for a mini bus instead. This was during the apartheid in South Africa at this time, and black people were not allowed to use public transportation. In South Africa the black people at that time came up with an informal, practically illegal system,  of mini buses. But these mini buses were ran by gangsters and violence. These routes were very unreliable, sometimes a bus wouldn't even come at all. Then they were just waiting there and hoping for a mini bus to come. No mini bus did come and so they decided to hitchhike instead. They ended up getting a ride from a passerby. But as soon as they got in the car, a mini bus swerved into their lane, and cut them off. The mini bus drivers walked out of the bus with these weapons and started and pulled out the driver, the driver of the of the car that they were hitchhiking with and started beating him. The mother said, Stop beating him, we'll get into the minibus, and travel wherever we need to go. You don't have to worry about this driver taking passengers away from your business. They ended up going into this mini bus. They bicker back and forth between the driver of this mini bus and Trevor's mother, who was a tribe member in the Xhosa community in South Africa at that time. The driver of the mini bus was part of another tribe. These tribes had stereotypes among the men and women across these different tribes. The Xhosa stereotype was being unfaithful. They were hoes or sluts as described by the minibus driver. They got into kind of a heated argument and the driver of the minibus decided to instead of, dropping them off at their destinations instead started speeding somewhere else. Trevor's mother realized that they were in danger, they could potentially lose their lives that day. She was prepared to hop out of the mini buses. So she told Trevor,"hey, at the next traffic light, or the at the next traffic intersection, when the driver slows down, we're gonna jump out of this bus". But Trevor was sleeping, he didn't really hear what his mother said. At the next intersection, his mom, When the bus driver was falling down, his mom pushed him out of the bus. He hit the pavement and started rolling down the road, and so and so was his mother. His mother had curled up his little baby brother into a ball and jumped out right after, right after she pushed Trevor. They both hit the pavement started rolling down the road, but they got up, and then they just started running away from the from the minibus driver. The minibus driver, you know, got out and tried to chase them. But they were really, really fast. Trevor mentioned that he grew up in an environment where he was forced to always run. they ran and until they eventually got to a petrol station, and they had evaded their the minibus driver, so they called the police from this petrol station. Trevor realized that he was actually in pain, he had cuts, bruises, scrapes, all across his body, and he was bleeding everywhere. But he hadn't noticed that just due to the pure adrenaline that he was running off of. He's talking to his mom, and he said, Oh, why did you push me under the bus? he didn't know that his mother just saved his life, he was just kind of angry at her for pushing her out of this bus and making and causing all these wounds.  Miraculously, his baby brother was completely fine. His mom and him had sustained lots of cuts and bruises and were bleeding. His mother goes on to say, thank god that were okay. Trevor was upset, since God wasn't on our side today, his mother replied, Trevor, I believe everything happens for a reason. If this happened, it was because God made it happen for a reason. Trevor, of course, still didn't believe that. He made a joke about how if God wanted that to happen for reason, he should just ask Jesus to, show up to their house the next day. She started laughing and they just ended up laughing.
