The story started with the narrativor talking about his country which seems to be based in South Africa. He first started talking about the end of the story but then he went back to the beginning. He said it was a normal Sunday. They were going somewhere. He think he ate porridge. He showered and his mom and his baby brother all got ready to leave. At this time buses weren't available to black people because of racism. The government operated buses but the black market of mini buses that still ran, which are available for black people. It was illegal because the government didn't know about it and was outside of the law. So black people use that. They wanted to use it. It was unreliable so the bus didn't come. They started hitchhiking. Then they saw car which picked them up and started and drove them as a form of hub. But then, bunch of Zulu men in mini bus switch, swerved in front of them, and then stopped them. Then they came out, while one of them was holding a weapon. He threatened the person that was helping them because he was stealing their customers. But then the mother came out and said, he wasn't trying to steal your customers. He was just trying to help. She said we wanted to go with you guys in the first place. So in the end, they went with the man, and the narrator described this man to be very aggressive. So as he was driving them, he kept scolding her. He heard her talk in a specific language. This tribe has a certain stereotype of women being promiscuous. So since he was already like scolding her for going into a car with a strange man, he said it makes sense since your from this tribe. you're promiscuous and you're with a strange man. The mother was also being aggressive, it seemed. She was trying to aggressively defend herself, verbally, obviously. He got really mad, and he started driving really fast. He seemed like he was attempting to kill them. So the mom had a plan. The narrator at this point was sleeping. Her plan was to throw herself and her kids outside the car while it was moving fast and they run away.  the narrator was sleeping, so she just threw him out her out of the car, which was painful, because you're going to be moving really fast. She also threw out the other child, Andrew, who's a young kid, she just held them in her arms and then jumped out of the car while like curling herself around him to keep him safe. Andrew was safe but the mother and the narrator got scraped and injured and they when they got out the narrative seemed to be angry so they were arguing about it. As the argument kept progressing, the narrator seemed to be ungrateful. Then he realized that his mom literally saved his life and then they stopped arguing after that. they start arguing about whether it was God's will or not God's will and then he said that God should have come to our house instead because this was not pleasant.  They also talked about how the mini bus business was corrupt and people would die because some specific people try to control specific routes. whenever some drivers drove in other routes, they could get killed by other people who wanted to maintain control of that certain route. there was a lot of bribery.
