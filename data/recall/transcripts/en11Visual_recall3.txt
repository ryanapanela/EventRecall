 The narrator Trevor starts off by talking about how in movies when people jump out of a moving car, they roll and the brush themselves off and are fine. Well, to Trevor its not like that. He was talking about how jumping out of a car let alone being thrown out of a car hurts. He also talked about how the day he was thrown out of car started off like any normal Sunday morning. He got up and got porridge and his mom was helping his little brother Andrew, who's nine months old, to get dressed. Then they went out to the car. I forget where they're going Sunday, maybe church, but the car wouldn't start. Then the mini buses wouldn't come because of apartheid and because they are in South Africa. They have different businesses, but black people were not allowed to use public transit. So they had their own transit system for many buses, which is basically organized crime. These people would have different routes, and they shouldn't steal routes from other people. But either way, they were waiting for many buses and the bus didn't come. So they started walking. They then waited until a car stopped for them. They got in the car, but when the car was about to start, a mini bus soars in front. Then a Zulu driver gets out with a Zulu weapon. He points at the drivers head. He's says, why are you stealing our customers? Then his mom goes, No, hey, stop, we'll get on the car. You don't have to do anything. Just let him go. We wanted to get in the minibus anyway, so they get in the minibus. The Zulu drivers are known for harassing the passengers. Though they start harassing them, his mom's not taking any of it. So she speaks but then the Zulu driver hears her speaking Xhosa. He realized she said she was a Xhosa woman. There are stereotypes for these different people such as Zulu woman are proper, and Xhosa women are promiscuous and  unfaithful. He saw that she had two children and one was mixed . Andrew was presumably mixed. Actually, I can't remember. So I shouldn't say that. But either way one was mixed. So he starts like calling her a slut, berating her, and she's defending herself. But then the driver says, You know what we call you women?  like, all sluts and everything, so i'm going to show you a lesson. He starts racing off. And at that point, Trevor reminisces. Yeah, they could have died, his mom could have been raped, they could have been killed. While the drivers racing his mom's trying to reason saying "we'll just get out". "We'll just walk" but the Zulu driver won't listen to her at all. And he keeps going. So then she leans over and whispers to Trevor saying "hey, when the bus when the minibus slows down next, we're going to jump out", but he's asleep. So he doesn't hear her at all. So when it slows, she opens the door, and she throws him out. Then she curls in a ball around Andrew and she jumps out. Then they roll out and she says run. Then he starts running. He doesn't question it. He says it's like an animal instinct. When his mom's ran, He just ran and they ran like gazelles. The Zulu drivers got out and were  shocked. They chased them but they didn't stand a chance. Trevor, and his mom smoked them. She was the Maryvale college champion. They were probably just shocked that a lady and two young children just got out and booked it. So they ran  to a petrol station. They called the cops but by then the minibus drivers were long gone. Now Trevor's looking at his arms are all scraped, his knees are all scraped, he's bloody and in pain. He and his mom had the same injuries. But miraculously, Andrew is fine, because his mom curled around him. He's angry. He says, why'd you do that for us? She was like, they were gonna kill us. He then said, well, then you didn't say that to me.She says, I told you to jump. Trevor says, I don't remember that I was asleep. She says, would you rather I let you there to be killed? Trevor says, "well, at least they would have woken me up to kill me". They start arguing. Trevor then says "You know what, we just should've listened to God when the car didn't start because God is telling us to stay home". She's says, No, that's not what God's plan is. God's plan was this. Trevor says, Well, I know you love Jesus and all that, but next time, can you tell him to meet us at our house because that really wasn't fun. She starts laughing. They're bloody. She's carrying Andrew and they're just laughing at a petrol station.
