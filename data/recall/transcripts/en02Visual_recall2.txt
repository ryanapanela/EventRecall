The story begins with him reminiscing about Hollywood movies and how they always do these large stunts, where they jump out of a car, or walk or something like that. Then they walk away completely unscathed. He comments that that's really unrealistic to what happens. It's clear that they've never been thrown out of a moving vehicle before. He says that it was just like any other Sunday when he was thrown out of a moving vehicle. He starts telling the story of when he was nine, and he his mother, and his little brother Andrew are on their way to church and they went out to start the car, and the car wouldn't start. They still needed to go. They decided they were going to take the mini bus, which was a unofficial unregulated bus being used in during the apartheid. Which was the case because the transit system in South Africa was available to white people, but not to black people or other people. They began this mini bus system which was an unofficial, unregulated way for black people to be able to get around to go. because of this, it basically became a crime hotspot, and there were certain routes for certain groups. If you were to interrupt one route with the on the other gang, that would cause big problems. Because it's an unregulated service, the bus comes if it comes, and there's nothing you can do about it. They're waiting at the bus stop for this mini bus to come and he's falling asleep. Sort of waiting for the bus and never come. The mom decides that they're going to hitchhike and she says, let's hitchhike. They start walking. And as they're walking, they get picked up by some people who are willing to take them. Just as they're driving, one of the mini buses cuts them off. They begin to start yelling how dare you know, steal my customers. The mom says, well, that's, that's okay. We were waiting for you anyways, and you didn't come, we'll just come with you. So they get out of the hitchhiking car, and they go into this mini bus. He shares that these mini bus drivers on top of being involved in crime also are quite pressing and enjoy harassing their customers. So he starts harassing this woman about what she's up to and she begins to stop. Well, she begins to talk to the young children in one language, which can't remember the language but sort of lets the minibus driver know that she is of a particular group of people. One of these groups is, you know, respectful. And the other one they're all promiscuous and disrespecting men, and apparently, she belongs to that second group. The mini bus driver starts to get angry and says, Well, you know, of course, this is why you're out with hitchhiking with these two young children. Because you know, you disrespect a man and no woman should be out with these two young children without her husband and she starts defending herself. The minibus driver basically says, I'm going to teach you a lesson. He starts driving really fast away. She keeps saying, you let me out here we can walk from here, it's fine, trying to escape the situation. he won't allow them. So she decides to turn to her child and says, you know, at the next stop, we're going to jump out of this car. He doesn't really hear her or comprehend her, and then the bus stops. She throws him out of the car while it's moving. And then she jumps out cradling the baby. As soon as they land, he's very disoriented. And he realizes how weird it is that he's not questioning being thrown out, because this doesn't seem like a regular occurrence. The danger is a regular occurrence in his life. And he stands up and finds his mother, and she tells him to run. They both start running, and the driver and his friends start coming after them, They realize that they can't catch up to the sports day winners. They run all the way to the local gas station and call the police. Then they argue a bit about saying, thank God that we were saved and then he retorts back saying we should have listened to God and stayed home. He says you know, next time if Jesus wants to pay him a visit, why doesn't he come to our house?
