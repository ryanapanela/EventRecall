The story starts off with Trevor describing his school experience with three Chinese children. Names are Bolo, Bruce Lee and John. Bolo got his name from a movie. Bruce Lee's name was literally just Bruce Lee, which was a blessing to them. John's name was just John, which they kind of found weird because the other two had origin names, but John just had what seemed like a white name. Bolo's parents were pirates and not the kind of pirates that that sail on a ship, rather pirates who bootleg games and then sell them for a cheaper price. Bolo is the son of these pirates and had a business of pirating things as well. This was in particular to video games. Bolo would sell some video games. On PlayStations, he would take them home then a few days later returned with a game that was pirated on their PlayStation.  Trevor also talks about this boy named Andrew who pirated some stuff. Together Bolo and Andrew realized they had a problem with the black kids they would use their services, however, would not pay them back. Trevor overheard this and said, "You know what, I'll be your middleman because I know how to get to the black kids. I can help you out". "However, I'm gonna need a cut". You're just gonna need to show me how this works.  Trevor worked with the both of them for about a year later on found that Bolo the left the school, which the rumors said that  his parents got arrested. It was just him Andrew. Andrew ended up backing out of the pirating business as well, but also taught Trevor everything he needed to know about pirating. He also gave Andrew a CD writer, which was pretty big back in the day. It was also very expensive. It was 2000 Rand in South Africa. Trevor started his pirating business, but this time it had to do with music. He would pretty much go home, write music onto a CD and sell them to school children, which had a good amount of music that he would download. However, he never judged. There was a lot of Montel Jordan, jagged edge, and Nirvana. He pretty much had it. It was kind of interesting for him to do the music business. In his home, or just according to him, the only kind of music he listened to or knew of was Christian music, which was the only kind of music his mom allowed into the house. Trevor had this friend named Tom, I believe, and Tom also helped him out with his pirating business. It was Tom who pledged the idea that Trevor should start mixing music so he would take the best songs from an artist and put it all into one CD. That really helped his business grow. The same friend decided to pitch another idea which was to a start fading music so one song feeds into another instead of a break and a pause and music. They sold well and elevated his business as well to the point where he started making party mixes and just a lot of people were coming to him for that kind of service. He made profit off of like those two suggestions. He had a lot of money coming in. He himself a cordless phone. The phone had pretty good range. He was able to use the phone about two blocks from his house to get McDonald's. He credits all of his success to his partner and friend Andrew, and he pretty much realized that with Andrew being white, he took a lot of things for granted that with Trevor assumably being black. He used the analogy: if you give a man a fish, he'll eat for the day. However, if you teach a man to fish he can eat for his the rest of his life. However, Trevor argues that you should also give the man a fishing rod in order for him to be able to eat for the rest of his lifetime. When people come at him and say that Andrew was pretty much given like a handout. He argues that no, he didn't he still have to work hard for what he had.
