This story starts out with Trevor saying that the first time that he got his hair cornrowed, he started getting female attention for the first time and he started going out on dates. He doesn't know what caused that increase in being able to date people. He said that once he figured that out, he wasn't going to change the formula. So he decided to continue with it. Every week he would go and go into the hair shop and get his hair straightened and corn-rowed. This was so that he could look nice and continue to be desirable and date. His mom, after he started this routine would joke and be like, "I don't know how you do it, I could never date a man who spent more time on his hair than me". Then he goes on to explain that his mom was the type of person who would look homeless throughout the entire week, and often would be in her garden looking homeless for most of the week. On a Sunday, when his mom was getting ready to go to church, she would get ready and get dressed up nice, do her hair, and she would look really beautiful. He doesn't really necessarily like to talk about it, because nobody wants to talk about how hot their mom is. He really believes that like she's beautiful inside and out. Even when she is looking homeless in the backyard and covered in mud gardening, she still looks beautiful.  Even with all that she still looks beautiful. She joked and said, Look at this, like you have to do all this to look attractive, But all I need to do is take a shower. She's the most attractive one in the family on those days especially. He starts to detail how his mom was gorgeous. She definitely broke a couple hearts in her lifetime. Instead of it being something that continued after he was born, she really only had two men in her life. That was his father and his stepfather. And so his father, I guess, when they were living with him, or I don't think he detailed that. But when he was explaining the story, he said that there was a mechanic shop that they used to go to that was close to his father's house. And at that mechanic shop, When they would go in, they would deal with a mechanic named Abel. He recognized that like, as time went on, they would start to go there because they had a lot of car issues. Slowly they started going there. Even when the car had no issues. He was young, I think he was nine years old. So he didn't really have an understanding of what was going on. But it would seem that like the mom was going often to talk to Abel. And then he describes Abel and he described him he was a mechanic and he was tall, lean, lanky but strong, and had long limbs and big hands. he was handsome, but he wasn't attractive.  his mom described Abel as a type of person who are the type of attractive or handsome that women like where it's not actually hot, but it's attractive to women. His mom and Abie are that's what she called them, she would call them Abie and he would call her Myubi, which was short for her real name, which starts with the N, I can't pronounce it. Those two started to I guess form a relationship together after she started after frequenting the mechanics place often. Then over time, they built a relationship. They got married and they didn't have any type of ceremony or anything. They just got together and sign the papers and they didn't really celebrate. There was no ring either. They just signed the papers and they were married. A little while later, they had his little brother Andrew. Andrew was born when Trevor was nine years old, so he was already older. He didn't feel affected by his brother that much because he was you know, not changing diapers. He says he was out playing games. With arcade, doing nine year old things, and he didn't really his life wasn't changed that much by his brother's presence. There was a bit of a time jump and he says, like life went on, he continued. Trevor became a comedian. He was doing podcasts, radio shows, performing in different countries. Being a successful comedian, he was living his own life. And then one night, he got a call from Andrew. He picked up the phone, he was, I guess, trying to fall asleep.  Andrew goes hi. And then he was like, hey, and then Andrew goes, how are you? , Fine, like, what's up? And then Andrew was like, are you busy? he's like, I'm just trying to sleep. Why? Andrew goes, mom's been shot. Trevor details that in this moment, he was confused for two reasons. One, he didn't understand why. Andrew opened up the conversation so nonchalantly with like, Hey, how are you? Are you busy? Because he feels that if someone knows that something like your mom's been shot has happened that that shouldn't be the first words out of your mouth when you answer the phone. The first words should be mom's been shot, not. How are you? Are you busy? So that confused him. Secondly, he was confused about the fact that he didn't need to ask any further questions. he didn't need to ask, who was their mom shot by he filled in the blanks. As soon as he said mom has been shot, he filled in the blanks to say, Abel shot mom. So he hung up the phone and he went over to his neighbor's house, and was like, knock, knock, we need to go. I'm not sure if it was before or after he went to his neighbor's house. But at some point, he started crying. He details the fact that when he was crying, it was like the worst cry that he's ever cried in his life. He just cried and cried and cried. He didn't know that if it was a type of cry that was like he didn't feel none understand that it wasn't the type of cry that was cathartic, or that was helping him with the sadness. It was a type of cry where he didn't know what to do. If this was a type of cry that if you were to look back at all his other cries, he would have slapped himself in the face. like, that isn't nothing to cry about because this was a cry like he had never experienced before. He's telling his neighbor, or his friend, that they need to go. They were going to drive to the hospital. And luckily, the hospital was only 15 minutes away. They get back into the car. They're driving, and he calls Andrew back to get more details, because like you didn't have that many details. he asked Andrew, who was calm and collected on the phone what happened? And Andrew's explaining where she got shot. He's like, Okay, we were coming home from church on Sunday. When we arrived home, Abel was waiting for us. He just started shooting. Trevor wanted to know where she got shot. So she had gotten shot in the leg. He felt calm about that, because he was feeling that the fact that Andrew was calm and collected and asking how are you and all that stuff meant that their mom was in stable condition, and that maybe he didn't shoot her anywhere critical because of the way that Andrew was acting over the phone. So he felt like maybe she's okay. When Andrew said, she got shot in the leg, he was like, okay, breath of relief. He continued on to say that she also got shot in the head. And at that point, he was crying again. He can remember specifically at what traffic light, he got this information. He was crying. He was angry, because he felt like he should have killed Abel. He knows that it's a bit ridiculous because he doesn't have the capacity to kill anyone. But he still feels like that's something that he should have done. Because this obviously led to this situation. He's driving through the tears, and they finally arrive at the hospital. He comes out of the car and sees Andrew standing in the outdoor waiting part of the emergency room. When he sees Andrew, he's covered in blood, but he's standing there and looks like calm and collected. Once he walks up to Andrew, he notices him. Andrew immediately breaks down and starts crying once he sees them because he has been holding it together the whole time. Their cries were different. He noted that their cries were different because his cry was one out of frustration and anger. But it seems like Andrews cry was one night of hopelessness. He's comforting him and hugging him. Once they left, or once they got to talking with the doctors, the doctor said that she's stable. She's stable, there's no point of you guys being here. You should go home and get some sleep. she's stable and there's nothing that you can do being here. So that's what they did. They went home. And then Trevor went back to the hospital first thing in the morning and just sat with her. With her eyes closed, she had a bandage on the back of her head. She had an eyepatch over her nose and her left eye. She was just laying there and he was kind of in disbelief about what was going on. Because he felt like, you know, hurt that this is his mother. This is like his partner in crime. The person that he's  done so much of life with. He felt really hurt by this and a little bit helpless, but about this and he stayed at her side and then eventually she opened her non injured eye, the non eyepatched eye. He started crying and she asked him for a sip of water and gave her some water. She leaned forward to take a sip of water. He was just crying and crying . She was telling him like, stop crying. It's okay, don't cry, don't cry. He was like, I thought you were gonna die. I thought you were dead. I thought you were dying. And she was like, No, I was never going to die. I'm not dead. I'm wasn't going to die. He just continued to cry. And then eventually, she goes, you know? It's a good thing. I didn't die. now look, you get to be the most attractive person in the family. That made trevor laugh and she was laughing and they're both  holding each other's hands and laughing hysterically. they just continue to laugh. He just details how he's crying and laughing at his mom's side in the hospital.
