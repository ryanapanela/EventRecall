The story starts with a young five year old boy. He always thought that Hollywood movies with the crazy scenes where people jump on a cars are complete BS. He thinks that jumping out of cars would hurt a lot more than they show on television. The story goes to the writers life. They start today normally eating breakfast. However, when they go out, their car stops working. They go out for the minibus to go to wherever they need to go. However, many buses are very irregular since the government did not offer public transportation to the blacks, whereas the white people still needed them to clean their floors. So the black people made their own transportation system. The writer said Necessity is the mother of invention. However, it was very dangerous since it was not regulated. There was a lot of violence, and all the money that was paid to prevent violence. minibuses were basically a group of organized crime. And they were unreliable since they were not regulated. Then the writer said they were waiting for the bus for a very long time. He felt his legs were very tired, up until a man drove up. Until this, his mother told them to hitchhike. So they walked for a long time. the writer felt his legs were completely dead, very heavy, until a driver drove up and offered them a ride. Just as they got on and started driving a minibus. In front of them a driver stopped, came up with weapons, a traditional weapon for hitting heads and grabbed the driver and hit him as they were yelling at him, ask him why he was stealing his customers. Why was he picking up people. And his mother was the writer's mother was never one to stay quiet. So she asked the men that were hitting the driver driver to stop. She said that he was just simply trying to help drive them. She said she would get on the mini buses car instead, just so she could stop the violence. When they got on the mini bus drivers, other than being violent, they were known to lecture their passengers. However, the riders mother was not one to be quiet and she was not sitting through the lecture of the driver. So she was just telling the driver to mind his own business. Thats when the driver got offended since  the stereotypical type of woman for Zulu people are very obedient, whereas the Xhosa people they are very unfaithful. For the mother with two kids, especially one mixed child, the driver called her a whore and a slut for not only being alone out but along with a mixed child so the driver called her a slut that slept with white men. The mother kept telling them to stop. However, the driver kept calling her slurs and and was driving at an extreme high speed. So the riders mother then tried to convince the driver to stop. She was apologizing and asking them to be let off the car. However, the writer was extremely tired so he was not alerted especially since his mother was also calm, so he did not know whether to be panicking or not. Then his mother whispered in the writers ear to tell them to jump in the next intersection when they slowed down. However, the writer was completely asleep since he was so tired. So once the driver eased off the pedal, his mother grabbed the writer hugging little baby Andrew, wrapping him around, throwing the writer out first and jumping along while wrapping around the little baby. The writer he said if he was any other five year old He would have panicked and he would have cried. He and asked his mother why She just thrown him off the bus. However, since he was in an environment of constant violence, when he woke up due the fall of the bus and saw his mother already up, telling him to run. He ran like a gazelle. He said it was his animal instinct, and he ran away from the predator. His mother ran along, wrapping the little baby and driver from the minibus. They tried to chase him. However, they were too fast. Since he was the champion runner of his school. They ran for a long time until they were ready to go to a 24 hour petrol station where they called the police. Then the writer realized he was completely running off adrenaline and he looked down and he was completely hurt. His legs were sore, his arms were all scratched up, along with with his mother's. However, incredibly, the writer saw that the baby was completely fine. His Mother wrapped herself around the new entry perfectly allowing them to be scrapeless. After everything. Director was very angry at his mom, saying that she shouldn't thrown them off the bus without waking them up. His mom told him that the drivers were about to kill him. He also wasn't aware of the dangers since Mom was calm. While the writer writing said that his mother could have been raped and they could have been killed. Ultimately, his mother thanked God for being alive. Finally, as they were calling the police. The writer was still angry since his nine year old self said he knew better and he will not silent this time. He told his mother that maybe it was God's will to not have them go out rather than the devil trick, that got them to go out. He said that God's will was by breaking the car. That was a sign for them to not go out. Whereas his mom told him that God has a reason to put them there at that place. Then the writer said If you love Jesus that much then just tell Jesus to visit us at their home. And suddenly they both broke out in laughter as they were in the middle of the street, waiting for help while covered up wounds. But they were smiling at last.
