This person recalls that three Chinese kids arrived at his school and hey were the only ones that were Chinese that were in his school of 1000 pupils. These Chinese kids names were Bolo, Bruce Lee and John. He said that Bolo got his name because of this character called Bolo Yeung from a movie called Bloodsport. Bruce Lee's name was actually Bruce Lee and that that this person found it to be was comedic gold and quite shocking, since that was his actual name. John was just called John and this person doesn't really elaborate on that. this person describes that bolos parents were professional pirates so they would pirate CDs and movies and sell them for a cheaper price. Bolo would also pirate video games like PlayStation video games. The school is called Sandringham.  People would hand Bolo their Playstation and Bolo would put a chip in it so they could play pirated video games. Bolo would work with this guy named Andrew, who was two grades above the narrator. The narrator met Bolo because Bolo was one of his tuckshop clients. One day after this person finished at the tuck shop, he overheard Bolo and Andrew. Andrew is described to be a computer whiz and someone who is quite smart. After this person's shift at the tuckshop, he overhears Bolo and Andrew complaining about black people and saying that they find it frustrating that they'll sell black people one of their pirated products and then the black people will say they'll pay them back and then they never do end up paying. This narrator says that that's just what black people do. It's inferred that the narrator is also black, because he says it's what we do. He said we're always trying to find something to buy to spend less money on but have more product. This narrator says I can be your middleman to Bolo and Andrew. He says that he wants to be part of their pirating business and that he can be the one in charge of selling the merchandise. He says that you guys should give me the merchandise, and I can sell it to people. I can also handle getting the money to you. He says all he asks Is he wants a cut of the sale. Bolo and Andrew agree, and now they're all business partners. It goes very well. He makes a lot of money from selling this merchandise. He makes so much money that he can afford to buy more memory for his computer. Andrew helps him install software so that he can download music and CDs. He says the only thing that he's missing is a CD writer, which is partly quite important to pirate CDs or to generate some sort of musical component. Andrew has CD writer but this narrator right now does not. That's the one thing he's missing. He says that a CD writer costs as much as an actual computer and has 3000 Rand. As time goes on bolo leaves their business and he leaves the school and it's rumored that his parents got arrested for pirating things. It's just this narrator and Andrew running the pirating business now. Andrew says, because you've been so loyal to me, he gives him his CD writer, Andrew stops pirating, and now it's just the narrator's business. This narrator now has the CD writer. He says with that he's able to be one of the first people in his high school or one of the first black people in his high school to have a handheld cell phone. This is because of the CD writer. he says that it's funny that he's in like the pirating music business, but he actually doesn't know much about music at all. He says that he built a surround sound system in his room from scraps that he found in Abel's junk yard, He said that he would spend five to six hours in his room after school making these music CDs to sell for 3000 Rand at $3. It was cheaper and he would sell a lot of product. He said that because of Andrew, he was now able to make a call with his friend and go to McDonald's and place an order and come back and still be on the phone. It's changed his life. He specifically says that Andrew has changed his life. This narrator talks about how he started to bring other people into his business and had his own middlemen. Someone called Bongani, who was from somewhere called Alex and someone called Tom who is from North view. These were his middlemen now, and bongani actually suggested to the narrator that instead of taking a copying a whole album for a CD, to make a whole album of people's favorite songs. It was like a mixtape. The narrator agree that this was a good idea. He started mixed taping CDs and selling them so people could have the songs that they like on it. He also said that he didn't judge people's music taste, he would sell Nirvana and BMX. To mixtape the videos, he downloaded this software called beats per minute. He would also sell a lot of Montrell Jackson, since a lot of people wanted that. His customers were really desperate to have black American music, since that was something that customers really wanted. That was probably the main thing they were selling . Bongani had another suggestion for this narrator. he would make the songs fade into each other, so that the beat would keep going, even though a song was switching from one to the next. The narrator though this was good idea as well. He started doing this and he felt like he was a DJ. The narrator acredits his success to Andrew. he starts saying the differences between him and Andrews life. Andrew is white and he says that Andrew came from privilege and that while Andrews parents were probably going to university or college, that the narrator's family, we're in huts learning multiplication tables. He says that, the phrase, if you give a man a fish, and he'll eat for a day, But if you teach a man to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime. He says that no one ever gives the man a fishing rod. He felt like Andrew kind of gave him that fishing rod. It helps a lot when someone from privilege can show someone else how to do something and teach them how it works. There's not a lot people can do with raw materials, especially when they don't have many resources. It's easier to say that poor people don't do enough, when actually they don't have the resources to be able to do enough or they don't have people showing them how to do it. Andrew was that person for him. He says that he doesn't believe that the CD was a handout because he still asked to work every day and figure out new things in the music business.
