The narrator starts the story by talking about how when he was in grade nine, three Chinese kids transferred to his school. Bolo, Bruce Lee and John, Bolo got his name from the movie Bloodsport. Bruce Lee's name was actually Bruce Lee, which made everyone in his grade Happy because there was this Chinese kid named Bruce Lee. And John's name was just John which was weird because the other two had more interesting nicknames. The narrator gets to know bolo because bolos parents are pirates. So they sold pirated media and bolo sells pirated video games at school to people with their ps4s, take them and then put in a game chip that allows them to play pirated games. One day Bolo becomes friends with this white kid named Andrew, who sells pirated CDs. One day, the narrator overhears them talking about how they don't like selling to the black kids at the school because they'll take the CDs and video games and then say that they'll pay them another time but never pay them. So the narrator says that he can help them and act as a middleman, since he runs the tuck shop at the school. So he gets involved in the piracy business at his school and takes a cut of the profits the other two are making. Eventually bolo leaves the school and it's just him and Andrew. But when Andrew graduates he gives his CD mixer to the narrator who wasn't able to afford one before because they costed 2000 rand which was about the same as a computer. The narrator began selling CDs, he sells them at 30 rand while they wouldn't be sold at a store for 100 to 150. So the kids like them. He creates his own surround sound system in his room with parts he finds from Abel's junkyard, and he mixes CDs. But he doesn't really listen to them because his mother only listens to Christian music. He starts mixing CDs and he finds his own middleman who suggests that he make CDs that aren't just one album, but a mix of the best tracks from different albums for people. So he begins to do that. His new friend also suggests that he makes the songs fade into one another. He downloads software called BPM (beats per minute) and uses that to make the songs fade into one another. It has a picture of two records on the software that make him feel like he's a DJ and people can listen to the CDs. He profits really well that he buys his own cordless phone. he's able to leave the base on his windowsill and walk to the McDonald's while talking on the phone. He talks about how that's a big achievement for him. Then he goes on to talk about how he wouldn't have been able to do it without Andrew who was quite privileged as a white person in South Africa. His family had lots of money and was able to buy the CD mixer and preparing for university. This was something that the narrator wasn't able to do with with his family. He talks about how the same teach man to fish and he'll be fed for his lifetime is missing a part. He adds it would be nice if you gave him a fishing rod. The narrator talks about how Andrew giving him the CD mixer really helped him be able to learn about selling and his natural talent wouldn't have been able to be developed without without that help.
