The story started when went four new students go into a boys' school when the narrator was in grade nine for Asian students. One of them had parents that were pirates. They pirated different things like games and music. Since he grew up in that environment, he also became a pirate. He started making bootleg media, and then he started making a business out of that. He was selling pirated media.He also made a friend called Andrew. They both participated in the business. Andrew also wrote CDs because he had a CD writer, which is apparently expensive and rare at the time. They just kept running the business. Then Andrews friend left the school because apparently, rumor was that his parents were arrested. They were both talking about like black students who would tell them that they would pay, but then scam them by not paying. They were talking and then the narrator heard them and asked them if he could be the middleman after explaining to them that black students do this because they're poor and they would try to scam to make as little money as they can. He could be the middleman since the narrator was also black. The narrator seemed happy about that. He started being the middleman. After that, the friend, not andrew, left because maybe his parents were arrested. So him and Andrew kept the business going. Then after Andrew was about to matriculate, or graduate. then Andrew gave him the CD writer. Then the narrator kept on going with the business. The CD writer was rare at that time so he seemed really happy and then he kept going on the business. He started making a lot of money. He flourished. He got different ideas, too. After geting the CD writer, some point, he also got two middleman. One was Bongani and the other I forget the name.  gave him an idea. Bongangi gave him the idea to put like different really good songs in one CD instead of just albums which sold well. He also got another idea to make the music fade into each other like party music. he did that too and and also made a lot of money from that. he got multiple CD writers and faster internet. He just he kept growing his business . The narrator started talking about like how he got a cordless telephone in which he said he could walk up to McDonald's and walk back without losing connection while being on a phone call the whole time. The phone was big telephone with a long antenna. The narrator started talking about what made him successful. He gave thanks to Andrew for the CD writer which helped him. since he already knew how the business worked, getting the CD writer made a produce,r distributor, and marketer.  He made a comparison saying that dont give them a fish, instead teach them how to fish. He said also give them a fishing rod which he considered the CD writer that Andrew gave him like a fishing rod. He thinks that that's missing from the common saying. He said that just because you teach someone something doesn't mean it's going to automatically be beneficial without actually giving them resources to perform whatever activity you taught them. He also said his parents would only allow Christian music in his household, which was the only music I listened to. He would  also not listen to the music he sold because of the saying that dealers didn't get high on their product. He also mentioned the names of the students that came. One was John, Another was Bruce Lee. His name was actually Bruce Lee.
