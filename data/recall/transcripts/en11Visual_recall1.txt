This story is about a guy named Trevor. It starts off with him talking about getting his hair straightened in cornrows for the dance. He thought that maybe the girls might have had a connection to that, because he was starting to look good. His mom would make fun of him about how she would never date a guy who spends more time on his hair than her. Then he goes on to talk about how his mom would get all dressed up and dolled up for church. She would take a shower, and she'd have a good natured laugh at him about how he took four hours to look so good. Trevor goes on to talk about how his mom is one of the most beautiful people he knows, but weirdly, she's only had two men in her life. This was his father and his stepfather. Then the story switches to talk about a mechanic's place. That  just a corner around his father's house, a mechanic named Abel lived there, and he would fix their car. Eventually, they started bringing their car in even when there was nothing wrong with it. He was maybe six or seven when he realized what was going on. He talks about how Abel was strong, but not particularly good looking. His mom talks about how he was like attractive in an ugly way. She talks about the stereotype that woman are just attracted to men who look kind of ugly, but in a cute way. Then he goes on talking about Abel and his little brother Andrew. He got a little brother when he was nine years old. He talked about how it didn't really change anything, because he was nine years old. He wasn't changing diapers or anything. Life went on. He went on to be a comedian and doing talk shows. One day, he gets a phone call from his brother. His brother asks him, how are you? Are you busy? Trevor says, no, and his brother goes, "mom's been shot".  Trevor thinks to himself, "well, that's a weird way to say hi". His brother goes your mom has actually been shot. Trevor says "The first thing out of your mouth should be your mom's been shot, not how are you or are you busy?" He  wakes up his roommate and says to his, God, I gotta go to hospital. My mom's been shot. His roommate jumps over to start the car so Trevor starts heading to the hospital. He's calling Andrew and goes, what happened? He was like, I just got home, you know, with mom, and then Abel started shooting. Trever goes, "so where was mom shot?" Andrew says in the leg. And Trevor feels some relief. But then Andrew goes, then in the head. And Trevor just loses it starts bawling and crying. He said when the traffic light turned green he could barely see but he still made his way to the hospital. Then he parks and his brother sees him. His brother is all stoic, really emotionless, and holding himself together. But the moment he sees Trevor cry, he starts crying too. It's like a helpless cry. Then the doctors tell them go home, your mom's stable, go home. So they go home. And they go back the next morning to see his mom. And she has bandages on her head. And then she wakes up. She was crying. She's says "don't cry" He's like, it's not fine. I thought you were dead. And she said, I'm not dead. I wouldn't have died. Trevor says "Yeah, but I thought you were dead". And she's says, "Hey, but at least there's some good to come out of all of this". Trevor says, "What could possibly be good about this?" She says, "Hey, at least now You're the most good looking one in the family"
