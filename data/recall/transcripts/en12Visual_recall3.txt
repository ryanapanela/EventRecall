Trevor describes Hollywood scenes and how when someone jumps out of a car, the actor rolls off after a moment stands up and dust themselves off. Well, that wasn't exactly the case for Trevor on this Sunday morning. He actually did get thrown out of a car, and it wasn't as effortless as the Hollywood scenes made it look. It was a regular Sunday. His mom woke him up, made him porridge, and he got himself showered. His little brother Andrew was getting taken care of and they were heading out. The car unfortunately wouldn't start. They had to wait for a mini bus. In South Africa, Trevor describes that white people are taken care of when it comes to transportation. However, when it comes to black people, they've had to make their own means of transportation, which is their invention of what they call a minibus. Drivers would take certain routes and pick up people who needed some sort of transportation. This operation wasn't really funded by the government, it was ran on or run by black people, it wasn't as reliable as it should have been. The mini buses came when they came and if they didn't, it didn't. On this particular Sunday, they're waiting for the mini bus to come in, but it eventually never came. This prompted Trevor's mom to be like, "You know what, let's hitchhike". They end up hitchhiking for what feels like forever. They get into a cab which offers them to drive to their destination. They didn't even get 10 blocks. Until a mini bus driver actually came up to the car that Trevor's family was in and asked them, "Why are you picking up like my customers?" pretty much. Trevor's mom spoke up saying that he really didn't do anything. We were just looking for a mini bus ride. "We'll just ride with you in the minibus, because that's what we wanted anyways". These men were holding weapons. It looked like the driver was about to be killed, which which is not a foreign concept. If routes are stolen, or even consider people to have stolen routes, drivers do get killed. Trevor and his family goes into the minibus. While they were riding the driver makes some comments about how Trevor's mom shouldn't have been riding in a car with a man who isn't her husband. She brushes him off and and she says something in Xhosa. He is upset at this point because he realizes like so has like his tribal enemy. There are two different types of women. There's Zulu woman, which are like respectful, submissive kind of women. And there's the Xhosa women which they pretty much do things on their own accord and the driver isn't a fan of Xhosa women. Trevor's mom now realizes that she's offended the driver, and she offers the driver to let them go. However, the drivers pretty resistant doesn't let them go. As Trevor sleeping, Trevor's mom wakes him up, and telling him that, "you know, we're about to be killed. I'm gonna need you to jump out this car at next traffic intersection when they slow down and you're gonna have to jump out and I'm gonna be right behind you. We're gonna run." Trevor just nods aimlessly because he's he's just tired. When they approach the traffic intersection, the mom opens the sliding door but trevor doesn't get out. So she decides to throw him. She follows right after. This is when Trevor went from asleep to fully awake, and the whole family including their baby, brother, Andrew, are running. They just keep running like a gazelle would be running away from a lion. The two men tried to chase them. Trevor thinks that they were just in shock about the whole thing. They just ran ran to 24 hour petrol station. At this station, this is when Trevor realizes that he's been running off of just pure adrenaline. He does see that, like, there are scabs and blood on his arm. Same with his mom. However, Andrew, his little brother got off without a scratch, which is great.  This then prompts Trevor to start arguing with his mom about why threw him out the vehicle and everything. Trevor's mom explains that I told you I was going to do that. I told you, you had to jump. Trevor is upset because his mom says, Well, thank God! Trevor responds by saying "God would have prompted you not to start the car to begin with".  They go back and forth about arguing about God's will and how like, you know, it was the devil's plan versus God's plan. Trevor ends it off by saying, you know, I know you love Jesus and everything, but next time, can you just ask him to meet him at our house so that we can just get to our destination safely? This prompts Trevor's mom to burst up into laughter and with a huge smile on her face.
