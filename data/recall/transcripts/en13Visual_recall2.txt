The main character is a Black South African, because of the currency Rand. In high school, he met three Chinese kids. That got him into selling bootleg CDs. That was also his introduction into the music business. Two of the chinese kids were in the music pirating business because their families were, and the main character made friends with them. He borrowed their equipment, and then helped be the middleman on their kids deals. The Chinese kids were scared of black kids, because they just took their merchandise and didn't pay them. They got CDs for free. The author at that time offered to be the second party to take the money and the equipment and distribute them. Everyone got what they wanted. The author also expressed as he was quite knowledgeable for his age back then that some black kids would steal the CDs because they had no money. One of the bootleg CD kids as families might have been arrested and they left school. The author acquired all of their hardware to sell more CDs. The other kid said he was going to exit the business and the author acquired all of his hardware too so now the author had the entire supply chain to themself, and was selling a ton of CDs. As the author grew older, he recruited people of his own to create an even bigger, illegal CD Empire. The author made so much money that he was one of the few black people in the community with access to the latest technology in computers in digital music and pirating. The author would walk around malls with a sort of proto-cell phone. He was able to call people without a landline, which was apparently very, very advanced technology back then. The author describes the music scene as a whole, and the empowerment of having people able to pirate their own music. The author also got to know a worldwide music styles because every song was going through their pirating business. The author also trained or taught other pirates, and said that was very good because it's empowered people like them who grew up poor, and didn't have the best knowledge in music, or in entrepreneurship. The author said how happy of a world when you can be a pirate and it doesn't matter if you are rich or poor. You just have to like music and put in the effort into learning how to spread the music as far as it will go.
