The story starts with the author talking about how three new  chinese kids were transferred into his class and how they were named John, Bolo who reminded them of Bolo Yeung, and Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee was a good looking athletic guy. That's why it was like funny because his name was also just Bruce Lee. The story is centred around Bolo, Andrew and Trevor and bolos parents were pirates. They owned a pirating business where they would pirate things. Bolo started doing it for himself. But he would do it with games. He was also friends with this white guy named Andrew. Andrew was like two grades above Trevor. They started doing the business together and selling to kids in the school. One time Bolo and Andrew were talking and Trevor overheard them saying whenever a black guy wants to make a purchase he wont really follow through with it. At that time bolo and andrew were afraid of black people. When Trevor overheard this conversation, he interjected. He said I could be your middleman because he already had a network and that he wanted profit for this. The three of them were the business.  Andrew kind of came from a wealthier family. The business kind of flourished, but then bolo had to leave because there was a rumor that his parents got arrested because of all the pirating. So then it was just Andrew and Trevor. Trevor was making a lot of money. with this money he was making parts of the computer because Andrew is also a computer geek. Trevor realized he was also missing like this one thing, a CD writer, which was very expensive. It was 2000 rands. That's something that like he kind of wished he had. Eventually Andrew had to step away from the business as well. It was up to Trevor to continue. Before Andrew left he gave Trevor his CD writer. Trevor had everything he needed to become succesful and make profit. He was all alone, running the business and getting money. Eventually he had like two of his own middlemen and one of them even suggests, to put the best tracks of like each album and only put them at on them CD. Another suggestion asked him to make the tracks fade into each other like a DJ thing. So trevor downloaded a different software. where they had like two files on this screen. It allowed for a better mixture between the tracks. It was like a DJ playing like the entire CD. He got really good at it. He was making a lot of money where he could even afford like a cordless phone. This was really big at the time. he mentions that because it was like super expensive, he now had the ability cast his orders and McDonald's. That was a big moment for him. He kind of recalls at the end that Andrew played a big role in how he was making profit and doing well for himself. Without Andrew it wouldn't have been like that. He recalls how Andrews had a very privileged life where his family is only had to be concerned with education and things like that. Whereas, Trevor, recalls that people around him would be doing simple math like two times two in huts. He kind of uses the analogy of Teach a man and he would be fed for his lifetime. He says what's missing from that phrase is how you cant do that without a fishing rod. For him Andrew gave him the fishing rod in terms of getting him started in the business and providing him with the knowledge and resources to succeed.
