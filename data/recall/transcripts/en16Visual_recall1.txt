When the narrator was in ninth grade, he had three Chinese kids move to his school. Bolo, Bruce Lee, and John. Bolo was named after a character in Bloodsport. Bruce Lee was named after Bruce Lee. But he was a good looking kid. So it made sense and made everyone laughed about it . Bolos parents used to pirate movies and CDs, music, and bolo would also trade stuff with his friends. There was Andrew, one white student at school who would also buy bootleg CDs. They were trying to sell  pirated CDs to friends in school. They were afraid to do it, especially towards the black kids. Then the narrator owned a barber shop and mentioned that they could do a deal and they could talk to the black students and get them to buy the stuff and then they'd give him the money back. They agreed to the deal. Then that deal worked out fine. Trevor had he had the business skills but then Bolo eventually left school. There were rumors about how his parents got caught. But people weren't sure. Another student came into the picture whose name I can't recall.  Andrew also gave the narrator see CD mixer, which he could use to make music and sell stuff. It was eventually him and Andrew. They did business for a while together. Then they drifted apart. With his CD mixer, the narrator will try to download albums for people and sell it to them. He'd never judge people's musics it was he mentioned one or two Nirvana songs that people wanted. He would not be judgemental of their music taste. Then one of his friends recommended that instead of doing albums, he could pick out music, like favorite top favorite songs from each album and put them into a CD. Then that worked out well. He started earning good money from it. Then someone recommended to have the songs fade into each other. That also worked well. He kept making good money. He made so much money that he ended up buying a wireless phone. A lot of people at that time didn't have a wireless phone. He mentioned how he could  walk around the block, go to McDonald's, pick up stuff come back and still be able to talk to someone. He was happy about how things are working out. He mentioned how Andrews parents were from a white background. They were well educated. They had access to university. His parents were learning and singing two times two is four, two times three six. He also mentioned that If you give up for a man a fish he eats for a day. You teach him how to fish he eats for a lifetime. But what he added was, it would also be nice if you gave him a fishing rod. Andrew gave him the CD writer and taught him, which was why he was grateful to Andrew.
