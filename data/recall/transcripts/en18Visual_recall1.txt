The story starts with Trevor talking about doing his hair, and getting it done in cornrows. He found that when he did this girls started to be attracted to him. It took a really long time to go to the salon to do this. His mom would tease him about getting his hair done. She would say that she could never date someone who spends four hours or more at the salon. He described his mom looking  homeless from Monday to Saturday, but then on Sunday, looking quite beautiful. All she did was take a shower. He talks about her confidence and how attractive of a person she was. Trevor grew up only knowing two men in her life, her dad and her stepfather. Their volkswagen would keep breaking down. They would take it to a shop called Mighty roads or mighty something to get it fixed. Then the mechanic abel would be fixing it. They would be going there quite often, almost to the point where there wasn't really anything wrong with the car. Then Abel and his mom got married, but there was no ceremony.
