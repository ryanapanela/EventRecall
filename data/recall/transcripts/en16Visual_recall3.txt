Trevor got his hair gone for a dance. Then he caught a lot of attention from girls in class and went on a few dates. That's when he realized that he'd wanted to get his hair done more often. He thought it was because he put as much effort into himself as much as the girls were. He would go to the salon, sit for a few hours, get his head on. He mentioned his mom who will work from Monday to Saturday in her office and in the garden. She looked like a homeless person that day, but then on Sunday, and she had to go to the church, she dressed up in a nice dress and look like a million bucks. Then her mom would always joke about how he would spend hours to go to the salon to look good, but she would just have to take a shower and dress up on Sunday for the church and look good. also that she was the better looking person. She would say that he was the best looking person in the family during the week, but on Sunday, she'd be the better looking person in the family. Trevor goes on talking about how his mom was always really beautiful and stunning and how he probably thinks she broke a million hearts when she was younger. Then once she saw then the only few people in her like once he was born, the only important man in her life was his Father, and stepfather. Trevor and his mother would have a volkswagen that would break down quite often and they would go so next to his father's place there was a mechanic store. There was this dude called Abel whom his mom would like to see and they kept going to the store and meeting him. Trevor mentioned how sometimes he felt like they went there even though there was nothing wrong with the car. Abel was handsome but not good looking. He was the ugly type that women like. They had nicknames for each other. One was Abie. Then they got married. They had no ceremony, no rings. He then had a younger brother named Andrew. Time passed, and Trevor became a comedian. He mentioned England. One night when he was about to go to bed, He got a call from his brother Andrew. He asked him how he was doing then said his mom got shot. Yeah, Mom got shot. Trevor takes a break and has an internal monologue of why Andrew would start the conversation with Hi, how are you? What's up instead of just being like, Mom got shot. And Trevor didn't have to fill the blanks. He just knew. Abel shot his mom. Luckily, the hospital was just 15 minutes away from where he was. He was like, Okay, I'll be there. Then he went across the hallway and knocked on his roomates door, and they got into the car, and started driving to the hospital. Trevor wanted to know more. So he called back and ruined he was like, what happened? And then Andrew was like, Yeah, we were on our way back from the church. And he was at home. As soon as we got out the car, Abel started shooting. Andrew mentioned, oh, he shot her leg. And then there's a slight bit of relief for Trevor. But then the next sentence was he also shot her in the head. That's when trevor felt like everything like his life, just like pause for a second and he started bawling. He even remembered that signal he was that. He just kept crying and crying. This was probably the worst crying he's had in years. Any other time he's cried was nothing compared to this one. He just cried. As soon as they arrived, he saw a sitting area outside the emergency room where, and he got on the cover, and he saw Andrew covered in blood. As soon as like they made eye contact or looked at each other. Andrew also looked decently calm. But then as soon as like they may made eye contact and looked at each other. Andrew broke down. He was holding it in just to get some support, and then they will hug each other started crying. Then they rushed inside. The doctors then said there's nothing much you can do for now. They recommended that, they take the night off, go back home, take some rest. Trevor, early next morning, went back to the hospital. Setting next to the mom just held her hand. He was thinking about how he just wished he had killed Abel, but not like he would but he still wish somehow he had the thought. He just kept holding his mom's hand making sure she was breathing fine. Then a few minutes later, She woke up and then Trevor started crying. Then the mom was like, Don't worry, don't cry, like everything's fine. And he was like, How can I not cry? I thought you almost died and she was like, No, I wouldn't die. Don't worry. Oh, wait. Yeah, I wouldn't die. Don't worry. Like, everything would be fine. Like, look at it. Like look at the bright side of things. He said, what's the bright side in this? Like you just got shot, you're like injured. And then the mom makes a joke about how well at least now he's the prettiest or most good looking person in the family. Then they just have a laugh about it and I guess just they had a moment of them laughing together and that's how the story ends. Trevor also mentioned how she was the top 100 Jesus supporter, and how something like this happen to her since she doesn't deserve any of this.
