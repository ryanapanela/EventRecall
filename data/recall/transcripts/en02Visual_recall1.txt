The story begins with the recollection that he began braiding his hair during the time of middle school dances and that's when he started getting noticed by the girls and started going on dates. And he would spend hours at the salon or working on his hair. His mother used to make fun of him for this, or poke fun at him for this, saying that nobody wants to date somebody spending that much time on their hair and is in that she was the most beautiful one in the family. He doesn't want to recognize how beautiful his mother is. But he does recognize that she is beautiful. No one wants to think about how hot their mom is. But he recognizes it. And he believes that he there probably were a couple of hearts broken in her history in her past. From his recollections is the time that he was born, he could only think of two men that she had been with, one of which was his father, and the other was a stepfather. He begins to tell the story of how the stepfather met where they would go to the mechanics, because their car supposedly was breaking down every week or very often. Although he suspected that wasn't the case. Slowly, she met or became close with this mechanic, I believe his name was Abie. They began that connection there. They got married in sort of a courthouse, there is no formal wedding. Nothing crazy. From that his brother was then born when I believe he was either seven or nine. He doesn't remember much about his brother being born other than he and his mom were gone for a few days and then came back with a baby. He wasn't super involved in the baby's life because it wasn't changing diapers, but he was out playing arcade games are hanging out in the neighborhood. Later in his life, he became a comedian and began touring around England and various other places. One morning, he wakes up to his brother Andrew calling him on the phone and begins the call by asking, you know, what are you doing? Or how are you doing? And whether he was interrupting his sleep, which he said he was? Which he found weird because then the brother reports that their mother has been shot. He finds it weird that you would ask how you're doing instead of just beginning the call by saying our mother was shot. He frantically starts preparing to go to the hospital. Then he wakes up his roommate to take him to the hospital before he realizes that he didn't ask anything about who shot him because her because he already knew that it was this husband that shot his mother. Feeling guilty about should have gone to the police because of this abuse has been happening for a while. Then he calls as he's driving to the hospital, he calls his brother back again to ask more about the incident and asks where she's been shot and he begins by saying the leg and he feels slightly relieved. Then it turns out that she's also been shot in the head. He starts panicking and he can still remembers the exact intersection or set of lights where he got that news. And he starts crying and crying out of anger and crying out of fear. By the time he arrives at the hospital to find his brother waiting for him at the sort of emergency room doors. The brother also starts crying but that's out of fear and out of not knowing what to do. He starts to wonder how something like this could happen to his mother who is a Jesus fan and how could God allow something like this happen to a woman who's done so many great things and so devoted to him. Then they go into the room, the hospital room, and she's asleep and he sees her and he is upset, I think feels a lot of fear about that. Later she wakes up and looks through her one unbandaged eye and immediately asks for water and then makes a joke about her or him being the most attractive one of the family now that she's been shot.
