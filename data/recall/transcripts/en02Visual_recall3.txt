The story begins with the recollection of when he was in high school. Three Chinese students began at his school. And they were the only three Chinese students at the school, which was cool. One was named after some movie that I can't remember. And the other one, was named Bruce Lee. And he was actually named Bruce Lee, which was cool because he was jacked and was fit like Bruce Lee. And then the last one was just named Andrew which was just disappointing. But one of the student's parents were pirates. He clarifies that he means that they sold bootleg versions of movies and music. These two students, Andrew and another student began a business where they were selling bootleg CDs to members of their community. One day he overheard them talking about how they hate selling to black people, because they always say that they're going to pay him later But then they never do. And the Narrator sort of chimes in and says, Well, that's because, you know, we don't have any money. And you know, let me be your middleman as a black person, then I can help you navigate out of that situation. So they agree. So he starts this middleman business where these two guys are making pirated music, and then he's selling it. And then one of the guys moves away. It was rumored that was because his parents got arrested. Andrew then continued to make bootleg CDs and got quite good at it. But then Andrew decided to give up his business. So he ended up giving the Narrator his CD writer, because that's the most expensive part of this whole operation. The narrator also couldn't buy the CD writer. He began his own business where he started writing the CDs. It was a one time speed CD writer, meaning that he actually had to listen to everything as he copied it. And so this was new to him, because, up until that point, he'd only really listened to church music that was allowed around the house. And now he began listening to all these other musics. And he didn't really judge people, he copy anything. And it ranged from, you know, Nirvana to local South African music, to music of black people from America. That was particularly high demand and the guru so successful that he started having these two middleman who were going to help him distribute, and one of them came to him and said, instead of copying entire CDs that you actually make mixes of the popular songs. He started doing that and that became wildly successful, as well as making party CDs, where they fade from one song to the other like a DJ. He got so successful doing that he started hyping up his business by buying better equipment. He even got this cordless phone way before people had cell phones where he could walk to McDonald's and back and be on the phone the whole time. And yeah, so it was, he was quite successful. And then he starts thinking about how the guy who came up with this idea was white. The advantages that he had to even be able to think this up, you know, he feels really grateful to this guy for helping him thinking about but he can't help but notice that these are the people who are already in success.  The narrator also says, if you give a man a fish eats for a day, if you teach man to fish he eats for a lifetime, but really what's being forgotten is that you have to give them the pole too, and he was saying that he's business savvy, and he was quite savvy, but if it wasn't for these sort of directives, that that was afforded by the white privilege.
