The story starts off with Trevor talking about his past and how he used to get cornrows back in the day. He started off getting braids for a dance. Then eventually he would go to the salon every weekend and get his hair braided into cornrows. He used to get them for dates as well. He used to like getting looks from girls. He used to either think that it was either because girls liked him looking like that, or that liked the idea of him being in pain just as much as they did. His mother also commented on his style and said she could never be with a man that spent more hours on their hair than she does. From Monday to Sunday, from Monday through Saturday, she would be in her office and also be in her garden. He described her looking like a homeless person. However, when Sunday came around, she would get all dressed up in a nice dress, do her hair, put on some high heels, and she looked great. She would make jokes or verbal jabs per se, at Trevor and say "it took you four hours in the salon to look like that". All I had to do was take a shower. She whould claim to be  the most attractive person in the house. Trevor couldn't deny it. Obviously he can't speak about how hot his mom was. But he did say that his mom was very attractive from the inside and out. There was some kind of confidence that she exuded even when she was in her garden covered in mud and in her overalls. Trevor could still see the beauty within his mom. Their Volkswagen kept breaking down. They went to a city in Yoville and went to this mechanic shop called Mighty mechanics. This is where they met a man who turns out to be his stepfather. In the story, Trevor also recalls that since his mom was so attractive, she's probably broken a lot of hearts back in the day. But there are only two men who were really present in her life, which was his father and his stepfather. After meeting their stepfather to fix their Volkswagen. It just seemed like they were going there like just to be there when the car wasn't even broken. Trevor describes Abel as like tall, handsome, a little bit lanky but strong. He was handsome but honestly wasn't really attractive. His mom  mentioned that he is some kind of ugly that women are attracted to. They formed a relationship. They got married, no exchange of rings, no huge wedding. It was just the signing papers and that was pretty much it. A few years later, when he was about nine, Trevor got a brother named Andrew. He really didn't know much about babies back then since he wasn't changing diapers or anything. He was just living his best life going to the arcade running around the neighborhood playing video games. Time passed. While Trevor became a comedian. He toured the country and was touring England as well. He hosted television shows and radio shows. One day around 10 o'clock in the morning, he got a call from his brother Andrew. It was a pretty calm conversation until Andrew broke the news that his mother had been shot.  Trevor didn't have to ask the question of who shot Mom, he already knew that it was Abel their stepfather. Trevor quickly went to his roommate's room and said that his mom had been shot.  so they have to be on the way to the hospital, which was luckily 15 minutes away. On the drive there. Trevor called Andrew to get a little bit more context about the shooting. Andrew says that him and mom were on the way back from church. Abel was waiting in his car. When they got out the car, she was shot in the leg and then in the head. Trevor lost it and was crying and bawling his eyes out. He remembers the exact traffic light of where it happened. As soon as the traffic light changed, he just kept thinking "just get there". By the time he arrived at the hospital, he saw Andrew who looked pretty calm. His clothes were smeared and blood. However, as soon as Andrew locked eyes with Trevor, that's when Andrew started crying as well. He was holding it all in until he saw his brother. They both embraced and cried together. Later on, the doctors told them that there's nothing that they can do. Their mother, however, is stable. They should just come back the next day. Trevor comes back first thing in the morning. The next day comes and he goes to see his mom with bandages around her face. However, there's one eye that is on bandaged. He lays with her for a while and then an hour passes by. Her unbandaged eye opens and that's when he loses it and starts crying. She asked her some water as she drinks it through. She asked for some water and brings it to her, she drinks it through the straw. She proceeds to tell Trevor, it's okay. No need to cry. Trevor says "How could you?" I thought you were dead. I thought you were gonna die. The mom proceeds to tell Trevor that she wasn't going to die. Trevor reflects on why this would happen to his mom because she prays she believes in God. If there was a Jesus club, she probably be in the top 100. He was  extremely upset about why his mom got shot and why Abel hadn't been arrested years ago. After Trevor calms down a little bit, his mom tells him there was no need to worry, because now you're the most attractive person in the family and they proceed to burst into laughter while he's still crying. They just continue to make jokes as the mother and son enjoy their time together in the intensive care unit.
