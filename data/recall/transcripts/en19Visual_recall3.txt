Trevor talks about how when he was getting ready for this dance, he went to the salon to get his cornrows. Then he noticed that all the girls in the school started liking him a lot more. He didn't know if it was because he looked good, or  the girls knew that he was going through the same pain that he that they were going through to get like all dolled up. He said that once like he started doing his cornrows, he didn't stop because like he liked the attention. Then his mom had said, I don't want a man that spends the same amount of time getting dressed as I do. He was just she was just teasing him about it. Trevor was talking about how from Monday to Saturday, she would wear office clothes and look like a homeless person working in the garden. On Sunday, she would look like a million bucks, getting all dolled up and dressed for church. Trevor said that, his mom would be like, who's like the best looking person in the family now like the Queen's back, like, I look so good. Then Trevor said that she said all of this in like a teasing way. He found his mom to be very beautiful on the inside and outside. Trevor's only known two men, in her life, which is his father and his stepfather. His mother started going to this mechanic place like down the street from his dad's house, it was like close to his dad's house. That's where they meet Abel, which ends up becoming his stepfather. They would go to the shop to fix their Volkswagen, that would break down like, a lot. Then Trevor found that they would end up visiting this mechanic shop like very frequently, and he wasn't able to like put two and two together until they ended up getting married and being together, he just knew that this man was suddenly in his life. He described able to be like this tall, lanky, but strong person and hit and he also described him as handsome but not good looking. I think the mom said there's like charm about some ugly, guys. The mom would call him Abie, and her Myubi. It's short for her full name. they ended up getting married, there was no ceremony or anything. Just they just started like living together and moving in. then they had a baby, named Andrew. Trevor wasn't too fond of Andrew. He just knew that the baby would cry a lot. And it would be annoying. As the years passed, Trevor ends up trying to become a comedian and is touring. One morning, he gets a call from his mom's phone, but his brother ends up picking up and the phone call was like,  Hey, how are you? Trevor was like, I'm fine. Andrew had asked Trevor if he was busy, and Trevor was like, No. Andrew had told him that his mom got shot. Then Trevor was kind of like confused as to like, why he would ask him all these questions instead of just getting straight to the point about their mother being shot because like, that's their mom. Trevor immediately knew that it was Abel that shot his mom. And he did. That wasn't even the first question that had that he had asked, because the first question he didn't ask was who shot her because he already knew that it was Abel. He asked her where the mom was in the hospital. Andrew told him. So then Trevor goes to his friend's room and tells him that his mom has been shot. So he jumps up and then they both get in the car together. They drive to the hospital, and he's on the phone and asked where was mom shot, and Andrew was like, Oh, she got shot in the leg, and then the head. And then that's when Trevor started crying. He said its like an out of body experience. He was feeling like, he was in control. He was driving, he had to, like, stay steady to drive, but like, he was breaking down also. He was just bawling. He was recounting like, all the other times that he had cried before, and he said that he was stop, those other his other selves, because those were moments not worth crying for this was a moment worth crying for. When he gets to the hospital, thinking that his mom had died, because Andrew said that she got shot in the head. Once Andrew saw Trevor crying, he starts to cry, and breaking down as well. Trevor had said that he was crying out of pain, and Andrew was crying out of helplessness. Then the doctors come out tell them the mom is stable.  So then they go home. Then the next day Trevor comes to the hospital, and to his mom all bandaged up I think her like right or left eye is banded, bandaged up. She looks  frail and weak in bed. He is like really upset. Then his mom starts opening as her eyes and she starts waking up. Trevor's just crying a lot. The mom was like, shushing him to be to like, be quiet. Trevor was talking asking God why this happened to his mom that his mom is basically like, God's super fan. If there was ever a list of all the people that would be God's fan, she would be in the top 100. This should not have happened to his mother. He also talks about how he wished that he could have killed Abel himself. Then he realizes how ridiculous that sounds because he's not capable of killing anyone. But at the same time, he said it anyway. Once his mother wakes up there. She's holding him, I think in her arms and like trying to shush him just to be like, okay, like, relax, I'm fine. I'm alive, I wasn't gonna die. And then at the end, they start joking around again, and they're just laughing in the intensive care unit and just like being together,  Trevor is just grateful that his mother is alive.
