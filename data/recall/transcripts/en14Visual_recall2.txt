The speaker says that when they watch big Hollywood movies, they see that actors being thrown out of cars. They make it seem like it's not that painful, because basically they just stand up and just brush the dirt off and start walking. That is not the case because trevor was pushed out if a car and it hurt a lot. They had to go out and the car couldn't start, so they had to catch a bus. They couldn't catch the normal bus due to apartheid. Trevor, his mom and his baby brother, Andrew were all waiting for the mini bus. The Africans created their own bus system which had their own routes. If somebody stole their route, they would die. Now they were waiting for the mini bus and there's no schedule for the minibus that comes and goes, so it had been a long time. Finally,  the mom said to Trevor, okay, let's hitchhike. They started looking to catch a ride. Eventually, they found a car and they sat inside. Suddenly, the car stops, and there isn't any bus behind them.  One driver comes to the passenger side window, and the other driver goes to the driver side window. Then they say that they asked the driver, "Why did you steal our customers?" So the mom quickly says that, they were indeed waiting for the minibus, but it didn't show up. They would love to go back into the minibus to go to their place of work which was going to somebody's house or office and then mopping the floors. They went inside the minibus, and Trevor says that some of the drivers are very vindictive. As soon as they sat inside the minibus, They started going, the driver kept on saying irritating stuff to the mom. The mom kept retaliating. There's this host of women, and this other kind of women, who are supposed to be sophisticated, good women, who are like loyal to their husbands, etc. The other group are like cheating women, they're not loyal to their husbands, sleep with everybody, etc. The driver gets more enraged as soon as he realises she is Xhosa. He then asks her, "why you start in somebody some other man's car", then mother gets very angry. The driver becomes very angry and threatens them. Trevor start's thinking "oh my gosh, they're gonna get killed or their mom's gonna get killed". The mini bus is now moving at a very fast speed and is only stopping at intersections to check for traffic. Trevor's mom whispers to him that they are going to jump out of the car. Trevor does not acknowledge that so basically, he is still very sleepy and is all of a sudden being pushed out of the car. His mother follows suit with Andrew his baby brother wrapped, like around like that very safely around the mother. They start running. Now, the drivers of the minibus they get out but when they get out they are way ahead of them so they start they don't even chase them since the mother is basically a college athlete or something. Anyway so they keep on running until they find a police station. At that point they stop so trevor starts shouting at his mom and then they have like a heated conversation back and forth. Trevor's mom says, "I told you we were going to like jump" and "Would you rather sit in the car and get murdered by those drivers?" Trevor says that we should have just stayed inside the house and the car not being started was a sign to stay inside. Which the mother says that Jesus was protecting them. So Trevor says that she should invite Jesus next week to their house. Both of them are bleeding, but Andrew is very safe wrapped around his mother. So when Trevor says that he they should call Jesus to their house both of them start laughing.
