Trevor is the person narrating. He talks about when he watches people jump out of moving cars, like in race car shows on television, they dust themselves off and kind of walk away from jumping out of that car. He thinks it's rubbish and that it must hurt a lot more than what the those people show. Sunday, he realized what it felt like to jump out of a moving vehicle. He talks about how he recalls the events of that Sunday and how his mother made him porridge for breakfast. And that he took a bath while the mother got his baby brother, Andrew, who's nine months old, ready. They went to their car to try and start driving, but the car wouldn't start. So they decided to take a minibus. The story takes place in South Africa, as we find out later on in the paragraph. Because of the apartheid, black people were not allowed to use the public transportation system. So they've relied on minibuses. He also makes a comment about how white people need us for cleaning their bathrooms, etc, But they can't ride the public transportation system. He finds that a bit ironic. Because of this necessity that black people need some system to travel, That's how the system of mini buses were created. He describes that the mini buses are completely unregulated. He says there's a lot of criminal activity that goes on in these mini buses because they aren't really regulated. He talks about how there's a lot of violence that happens on these mini buses. If rival gangs tried to steal someone else's mini buses, it can create an all out fight and a lot of violence. It's the only way for him to get around. So especially since their car broke down, They're waiting for a mini bus at Rosebank union. He's falling asleep because it's taking a while. There's no mini bus in sight. No mini bus is available at the time that they're there. His mother says to him, let's hitch hike. They find a driver who lets them in. Not even 10 feet of them driving that car, A minibus swerves into them. Then a Zulu driver of the minibus comes out with a traditional Zulu or South African weapon.  I can't recall if it was a Zulu specific weapon, but it was called Iwisa. It was a club used to hit us to break someone's skull. The mini bus driver was very angry at this driver . He came out of his mini bus with more people with these weapons. They tell the driver why are you stealing our customers? Then the mother, to try and create some peace in the situation, says that the driver was only driving us because we couldn't find a minibus and now we'll ride with you. But they still start hitting this driver in the face with the Iwisas. Time goes on and then the mother, The little brother, Andrew and Trevor are on the mini bus. Trevor says it's common for mini bus drivers to complain judge the people on the mini bus and start conversations with them that are incredibly judgmental of the customers lifestyles. This mini bus driver makes a comment about how it's disrespectful that the mother was driving with someone who wasn't her husband. The mother says to stay out her business in her in something called an Xhosa. I think it's the language, the dialect that she speaks. He recognizes this, and it's his tribal enemies language. He already feels prejudice against her. Because they're in South Africa, it said that Zulu women are very respectful and submissive, whereas Xhosa, women are very rude and not respectful of men. He already starts harping on her for this and says that, Oh, of course, your Xhosa women, like they're all sluts. He calls her a whore as well. It just goes back and forth with them arguing. He said that tonight, she'll be taught a lesson, And he starts speeding up the minibus. Trevor wasn't worried because he saw that his mother wasn't worried. she was keeping calm saying I'm sorry, if we've upset you. Just let us off at the next stop. We won't cause any trouble. Trevor didn't think anything was going on. The driver says no, I'm not going to stop. So he just keeps speeding up. Then the mother whispers in Trevor's ear, that when the driver of the minibus gets to the next intersection, when he slows down you need to jump out of the minibus. Trevor didn't really hear her though, because he was nodding off and falling asleep. He wasn't really aware of what was going on. So when the driver gets to the intersection and slows down, the mother shoves Trevor out of the minibus, and he's completely disoriented and didn't know what was going on. He just slams onto the pavement. then he looks behind him and his mother. The mother wraps Andrew in a blanket or kind of covers him with her own clothing. She jumps after Trevor through the sliding door of the minibus. Trevor's completely disoriented and kind of says to his mother, what's going on? Then the mother says to run. He runs very quickly. He talks about how if he hadn't been living in this type of life, where there's a lot of violence and a lot of uncertainty and chaos in his environment, he probably would have been dazed and confused and not have run as quickly as he did. Because he's lived such a turbulent lifestyle in South Africa at the time, when his mother says to run, he runs straightaway. The mother, holding Andrew, runs very fast with Trevor. Trevor says he can look behind him and he saw that the mini bus drivers were trying to run after them, but they were too fast. Trevor said they were probably thinking how could a mother and her two young children run so fast? He said that they don't know that they're were Maryville college champions. That's why they were able to run so fast. this was because of her background in this potentially. They ran very fast and the minibus drivers gave up chasing them because they were running a lot faster than them. Then the mother, Trevor, and Andrew ended up at this 24 hour petrol station. That's when they called the police. Trevor just felt adrenaline. Now that the adrenaline was slowing down, he realized the amount of pain he was in. He saw that his legs had been scraped and cut, and his mother was also hurt, too. But luckily, baby Andrew wasn't hurt. The mother had covered him up. Trevor traveler feels immense relief that they hadn't died or nothing horrible really happened to them and they weren't physically harmed too badly. The mother says, Thank God, we're all right.Trevor gets a bit angry and says,you should have listened to God, when the car didn't start, and we should have stayed at home. The mother said that to Trevor God always has a plan and then we were supposed to be in that mini bus on that day. He said, If you want to see Jesus, you should meet him in our home, because tonight wasn't really fun. I think he was alluding to the fact that they could have been very close to dying and potentially seeing Jesus. They just laughed about it and laugh through the pain.
